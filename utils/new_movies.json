Before long Kaoru's father deserts them, and not long afterward Yota's mother becomes terminally ill. Her dying wish is for him to watch out for Kaoru at his grandmother's place on a small island off the coast of Okinawa. He fulfills her wish and becomes very protective of his younger sister who calls him \"nee-nee.\" Thirteen years later Kaoru returns to Naha and comes to live with him as she starts high school. Yota works hard making deliveries of vegetables from an open-air market by day, and in a restaurant (he is a licensed chef) by night to save money to fulfill his dream of having his own restaurant. He also assumes the role of pushing for Kaoru's entrance to a university. This allows less time for his beautiful girlfriend Keiko, the daughter of a doctor and a medical student at Ryukyu University. It seems that Yota's dreams start to come together when Mr. Kameoka sells him a place for a restaurant. Yota works hard constructing the place, but just as he is to open, the real owner appears. Being swindled, Yota is left with a large outstanding loan. Keiko's father's plans do not include a working class son-in-law as he explains when he offers to pay Yota's debt.

Nerdy Mortimer, happy to be on break from school and his less-than-understanding schoolmates, is trying to increase his popularity with his mostly ill-fated YouTube posts. Meanwhile, young refugee girl Sara--afraid she must leave the only country she has ever known and be forced back to a country she's never seen- is hiding from everybody. No friends, no family, just her little gnome dolls that she keeps as her only companions. But everything changes one morning when an animal crashes into the very home where Sara is hiding. This is no woodland creature, but a young dragon who,much like Sara herself, is all alone in the world trying to find his way to where he belongs. Another chance encounter introduces Mortimer into the situation. Can these three lost souls help one another during this magical Christmas and give one another the love and support to find their way through bullies, Christmas festivals, cops, soldiers (and flaming dragon poop) to have homes for Christmas?", "yt_trailer_code": "", "language": "no", "mpa_rating": "PG", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/dragon_girl_2020/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/dragon_girl_2020/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/dragon_girl_2020/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/dragon_girl_2020/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/dragon_girl_2020/large-cover.jpg", "state": "ok", "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/B2A9DAE9C19B48FFCAE17C07ED11C0938D7589F2", "hash": "B2A9DAE9C19B48FFCAE17C07ED11C0938D7589F2", "quality": "720p", "type": "web", "seeds": 66, "peers": 3, "size": "754.45 MB", "size_bytes": 791098163, "date_uploaded": "2022-11-23 20:06:30", "date_uploaded_unix": 1669230390}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/123917C20463C81A6035B41A7E3B6A6910F7A479", "hash": "123917C20463C81A6035B41A7E3B6A6910F7A479", "quality": "1080p", "type": "web", "seeds": 55, "peers": 19, "size": "1.51 GB", "size_bytes": 1621350154, "date_uploaded": "2022-11-23 20:54:52", "date_uploaded_unix": 1669233292}], "date_uploaded": "2022-11-23 20:06:30", "date_uploaded_unix": 1669230390}, {"id": 46901, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/anita-2021", "imdb_code": "tt15010590", "title": "Anita", "title_english": "Anita", "title_long": "Anita (2021)", "slug": "anita-2021", "year": 2021, "rating": 7, "runtime": 137, "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History", "Music"], "summary": "Traces the life of Anita Mui, Hong Kong's legendary Cantopop star.", "description_full": "Traces the life of Anita Mui, Hong Kong's legendary Cantopop star.", "synopsis": "Traces the life of Anita Mui, Hong Kong's legendary Cantopop star.", "yt_trailer_code": "g3S-2XTn-kI", "language": "cn", "mpa_rating": "", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/anita_2021/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/anita_2021/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/anita_2021/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/anita_2021/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/anita_2021/large-cover.jpg", "state": "ok", "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/311043184CC1DF0A3A6891AA99B5E3670F233D7A", "hash": "311043184CC1DF0A3A6891AA99B5E3670F233D7A", "quality": "720p", "type": "web", "seeds": 18, "peers": 5, "size": "1.23 GB", "size_bytes": 1320702444, "date_uploaded": "2022-11-23 20:22:09", "date_uploaded_unix": 1669231329}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/3BDA3F0F0E95EFC0D8682C4B055F5C0839976E9A", "hash": "3BDA3F0F0E95EFC0D8682C4B055F5C0839976E9A", "quality": "1080p", "type": "web", "seeds": 22, "peers": 10, "size": "2.52 GB", "size_bytes": 2705829396, "date_uploaded": "2022-11-23 21:53:57", "date_uploaded_unix": 1669236837}], "date_uploaded": "2022-11-23 20:22:09", "date_uploaded_unix": 1669231329}, {"id": 46900, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/shelf-life-1993", "imdb_code": "tt0108111", "title": "Shelf Life", "title_english": "Shelf Life", "title_long": "Shelf Life (1993)", "slug": "shelf-life-1993", "year": 1993, "rating": 7.3, "runtime": 81, "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Musical"], "summary": "On November 22, 1963, Mister and Misses St. Cloud hear about the tragic assassination of the President of the United States John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

She and Flip soon find themselves on an incredible journey traversing dreams and fleeing nightmares, where Nemo begins to hope that she will be reunited with her father once again.",

The movie was developed and filmed with the inclusion of Marshallese people through film workshops that have run over a period of nine months.
