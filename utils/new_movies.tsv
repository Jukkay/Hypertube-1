Deciding amid increasingly dire warnings for the planet makes it even more paralysing. ""The Climate Baby Dilemma"" explores the state of what to expect when you're expecting... climate change. With the future promising to be increasingly unstable and insecure, conversations about parenthood are heating up. Over the course of three years, the film follows prominent science writer Britt Wray, as she delves further into this complex issue - hosting workshops, giving talks, and speaking to activists, psychologists, parents and prospective parents. The film also meets many youth at the centre of the climate moment. A growing number of Gen-Z and millennials are either refusing to bring a child into an increasingly unstable world or struggling with the question of whether they should. Those deciding to have children, while being very climate aware - like activists Sarain Fox and Severn Suzuki - offer perspectives and lessons for raising children in the climate crisis. Through her research, Britt considers how one can transform climate anxiety and grief into transformative action. For many, the best antidote to feeling powerless is activism - and that can take many forms, including the decision not to have a child."

"Hollywood television star Mike Mitchell heads home to the Hudson Valley in upstate New York for the Christmas hiatus, planning for a quiet holiday, especially as he contemplates popping the question to his childhood friend, divorced travel agent Andi Cruz. In the thought of proposing to Andi, he is also trying to be more of a parental figure to Andi's son Noah, especially as Noah's father, Ryan Zane, who has a history of being in and out of his life, has once again re-entered his son's life with a bang. This Christmas would be unlike the near fiasco of last Christmas, the final year of the Mitchell family's ""Christmas house"": his parents Bill and Phylis Mitchell's long-held tradition to transform completely their family home for Christmas, the last year as Bill and Phylis have since retired and want to focus on other things in life. The other people involved, Mike's older brother, bakery owner Brandon Mitchell, his architect husband Jake, and their two infant children, are coming from Denver also wanting to eke out their own family Christmas traditions between the four of them, they staying in Andi's mother's otherwise empty house next door.

Jason, currently working out of his New York office, has launched his latest project, a mail order, genetically perfect Christmas tree service, after its launch which he will take a hiatus from work to focus on finding himself. This Christmas season will be the third that Harper will have led her pet project, Six Degrees of Santa. With a modest online presence, the project provides solely the inspiration and the recognizable gift boxes, the rest done by the legions of Secret Santas who use the boxes to send a gift of some meaning to whomever, from a best friend to a total stranger, that person keeping that gift for a couple of days before becoming its second Secret Santa to move that gift along, and so on, with the sixth receiver of that gift to be its owner, with he/she not necessarily knowing anything about the five previous givers of the gift. Harper hopes to bring some human connection important at Christmas through this project. The sixth recipient of one of Six Degrees of Santa gifts is Jason, the gift an out of print children's book, Northbound Elf, with an inscription by its Santa #1 writing about how much the book meant to her as a child and how it has shaped her life, feelings mirrored by Jason who believes Santa #1 may be his soulmate who he is determined to locate. Jason is able to locate Harper, after a recent antagonistic encounter with her and discovering that she is an ex-employee of his, for her to help him find that Santa #1. She eventually agrees on his proposal that he in return help expand the online reach of McNevin's which may close unless business picks up. The problem for Harper in agreeing to this proposal is that she is said Santa #1 who has no interest in having a personal relationship with Jason as he envisions. As such, she enlists one of her neighbors, social media influencer Zoe who is all about promoting herself, to be Santa #1, Zoe, with Harper's blessing, who sees a business benefit in a relationship with Jason but not a long term personal one. The problems become that Zoe does end up falling for Jason despite there really being no human connection between them stemming from the book, and that Harper too sees a different, more human side to Jason in spending time together, the longer she waits to come clean that she is really Santa #1 the less palatable the information will be to Jason. Harper and Jason forming a long term bond is further threatened by Jason's initial implication that he could hijack non-copyrighted Six Degrees of Santa to make it into more of a business.

The second episode recaps the discoveries beyond the frontiers of our solar system.

Taylor, the head of MI7, wants to insert agents working on the file undercover into the palace without the royal family being aware of the potential threat against them, the only two available positions being Protection Officer, assigned to Agent Wallace, and Royal Nanny, assigned to Agent Claire Champion. Claire does not believe she the best person for this specific undercover assignment in knowing nothing about children and raising such in a nurturing environment having been raised in an orphanage herself and having no children of her own or in her life, something to which MI7's case specific advisor Juliet Lansbury concurs, she who has trained and provided the nannies for the royal family for a generation. With no other agent as an alternative, Mrs. Lansbury has twenty-four hours to train Claire, who will go by the name Claire Carter, to be the proper nanny, the end goal, both as a nanny and as an MI7 agent, to protect Princess Elle and Prince Robert at all cost. Claire will discover that the biggest threats against her as a person are her charges, who have taken it upon themselves to prank their previous nannies to the point of they wanting to quit. The Princess and Prince have as their biggest ally their uncle, Princess Rose's younger brother, fourth in line Prince Colin, who does not live at the palace but visits frequently, he the head of the royal family's Christmas charity of providing toys to children at orphanages. Beyond the issues with the Princess and Prince which relates directly to Princess Rose's self assessment that she wants and needs to be a more present part of her children's lives, difficult with all her royal duties, Claire has the difficulty of dealing with Prince Colin in those nanny/agent duties. In spending time with them, Claire is able to break down the defenses of her two charges and their uncle, Claire and Colin who seem to be falling for each other. A problem arises when Taylor receives further evidence that Prince Colin himself may be that threat against the royal family, his own family.

He was nominated to the Zwaan award for 2010's most impressive dance production. His new full-length ballet A Swan Lake, nominated for a 2015 Benois de la Danse, takes a fresh look at Tchaikovsky's classic work. On stage we see The Norwegian National Ballet, dressed in costumes by Danish fashion designer Henrik Vibskov.	tuxKKBu9WKE	en		https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/a_swan_lake_2014/background.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/a_swan_lake_2014/background.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/a_swan_lake_2014/small-cover.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/a_swan_lake_2014/medium-cover.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/a_swan_lake_2014/large-cover.jpg	ok	[{'url': 'https://yts.mx/torrent/download/FEE188E2B273532371F21EB44A2E344EF5269864', 'hash': 'FEE188E2B273532371F21EB44A2E344EF5269864', 'quality': '720p', 'type': 'web', 'seeds': 13, 'peers': 2, 'size': '895.24 MB', 'size_bytes': 938727178, 'date_uploaded': '2022-11-24 15:25:15', 'date_uploaded_unix': 1669299915}, {'url': 'https://yts.mx/torrent/download/6E5AB8F928FD85D841DB38E16CC1CBA2FDCB9ADA', 'hash': '6E5AB8F928FD85D841DB38E16CC1CBA2FDCB9ADA', 'quality': '1080p', 'type': 'web', 'seeds': 34, 'peers': 7, 'size': '1.62 GB', 'size_bytes': 1739461755, 'date_uploaded': '2022-11-24 16:30:06', 'date_uploaded_unix': 1669303806}]	2022-11-24 15:25:15	1669299915

Nerdy Mortimer, happy to be on break from school and his less-than-understanding schoolmates, is trying to increase his popularity with his mostly ill-fated YouTube posts. Meanwhile, young refugee girl Sara--afraid she must leave the only country she has ever known and be forced back to a country she's never seen- is hiding from everybody. No friends, no family, just her little gnome dolls that she keeps as her only companions. But everything changes one morning when an animal crashes into the very home where Sara is hiding. This is no woodland creature, but a young dragon who,much like Sara herself, is all alone in the world trying to find his way to where he belongs. Another chance encounter introduces Mortimer into the situation. Can these three lost souls help one another during this magical Christmas and give one another the love and support to find their way through bullies, Christmas festivals, cops, soldiers (and flaming dragon poop) to have homes for Christmas?

From that solemn trek, Jim-the shy outdoorsman and eventual CEO of REI-and RFK ignited a friendship over their shared love of wilderness. In the following years their lives would intertwine, both men having a profound effect on the other. But their shared path would end with an assassin's bullet. In June of 1968, Jim would look on as Bobby was taken off life support. 50 years later, Jim's son Bobby Whittaker- a legend of the grunge scene- decides that he and his brother Leif must ascend the mountain.

The daughter, feeling powerless, agrees despite being scared as if the Taliban discover her masquerade, she is certain they will kill her. Partly as a symbolic measure, the daughter plants a lock of her now cut hair in a pot so that her lost femininity can flourish. The only people outside the family who know of the ruse are the milk vendor who employs the daughter - he who was a friend of her deceased father - and a local boy named Espandi who recognizes her despite her outward change in appearance. Espandi renames her Osama. The masquerade becomes more difficult when the Taliban recruit all the local boys to school, which includes military training.

His reason is the famine to which his tribe of Mescalero Apache is subjected to. The newly drawn Mexico-USA border line prevents the Apache from hunting on either side of the border. These reasons are of little consolation for the American settlers who feel the wrath of Apache attacks. In the town of Spanish Boot, inhabited mostly by Welsh silver miners, Mayor Joe Madden decides to preserve the clean image of a hard-working town by evicting the bad elements. Among them, Madam Betty Careless and her girls are told to leave town. Also, card-shark gunfighter Sam Leeds is ordered out of town but he suspects that Joe Madden simply wants him out of the way due to their romantic rivalry concerning cantina owner Sally. Madam Betty Careless and her girls leave for Silver Springs by wagon. Following a ways behind on horseback is Sam Leeds. At a mountain pass, Sam stumbles upon the dead bodies of Betty and the girls killed by Apache arrows. He returns to Spanish Boot to warn the townsfolk but no one believes him. When they're about to run Sam out of town for the second time, the stagecoach arrives but everyone on the stage is dead, killed by Apache arrows. Realizing that Sam's warning was true, the townsfolk hold council. A small platoon of cavalry, led by Lt. Glidden, arrives in town and they help the locals organize a defense. One man on horseback is sent to the nearest army fort to bring reinforcements. Unfortunately, the dead body of this man is discovered the next day in the town's water well. The locals now have to bring water from a far-away river that flows on Apache lands. They also have to bury the dead, including the bodies of Betty and her girls. During the funeral, the Apache attack the town. Some locals are killed while the rest, escorted by Lt. Glidden and his men, take refuge in the sturdily built church and they barricade the heavy oak doors. Outside the church Apache Chief Victorio and 200 braves prepare to burn the emptied town, to assault the church and kill everyone. Throughout the night, the Apache incessantly beat their drums and probe the church's defenses with small attacks but they plan a major assault for the next morning. Running low on food, water and ammunition, the people trapped inside the church are praying for a miracle.

While not as skeptical about love as Tracy, Emma is romance-shy in still feeling the sting from her latest break-up in believing at the time that her now-ex could have been the one if it wasn't for the long-distance circumstance. All they know about the veil is that it was featured in a late nineteenth-century painting by artist Amici. Starting at the Italian lace center of Burano, Emma does discover the two-centuries-old family lace shop where the veil originated. Emma is also surprised to discover that the Italian man who she has constantly encountered while in Burano and whom she felt was following her was more the opposite in he being Paolo Listetto, the next generation in that lace-making family. While Paolo's family can only tell Emma about the veil's origins and its appearance in the painting, they don't know anything about the intervening time to today and how the veil made its way to San Francisco where Emma and her friends purchased it. On behalf of his family, Paolo joins Emma in the quest to discover the veil's history, for Paolo to fill in the gaps for his own sense of family. While the power of the veil seems to be working on both Emma and by association widowed Paolo in they falling for each other, they will have to decide whether to act on that power in the geographic distance that exists in their everyday lives, including being separated by an ocean, and as Paolo is in a fight with his family about the direction of the business.

Against the odds Bill escaped a bleak future in post-war, working class London to find himself at the very centre of a musical and cultural revolution. As a Rolling Stone he embarked on record-breaking world tours, dealt with feuding band mates and befriended some of the world's most iconic musicians, actors, sportsmen and artists. Then, to people's amazement he walked away from it all to commit to a new family and to set about documenting and preserving the memory of the 'rock and roll revolution'. Since leaving the Stones Bill has toured the world with his all-star band the Rhythm Kings as well as exhibiting his renowned photography. A keen archaeologist, Bill acts as a historical consultant on film and documentary projects and has written nine books on a variety of subjects. Throughout his career Bill shot hours of unseen film footage, took thousands of photographs, collected a vast archive of memorabilia and kept a detailed diary of each and every single day. Watching this footage and hearing the stories is like going back in time and standing at Bill's shoulder, experiencing this privileged access at first hand. The film uses his huge archive as the catalyst for stories about Bill's experience of wartime poverty, his love of blues music, the rise of the Rolling Stones, the 1960s counter culture, exile in France, his 1970s super groups, 1980s excesses and his life's work documenting and preserving the memory of such an important period of cultural and musical history.

The problem for her is that that generation has long come and gone, her dwindling number of fans who only want to hear her most famous song from early in her career, Sugar Rush, instead of anything new. As such, she has been without either a record deal or representation for years, she self-plugging her latest demo of new material to record companies. As this Christmas season's ""A Very Darcy Christmas"" series of concerts seem not to be getting her any new recognition, she decides to accept her recently widowed sister Gretchen's offer to spend Christmas with her and her daughter Megan for the first time since she was a teenager in their hometown of Dayton OH, Gretchen who is still struggling with that loss, especially hard during the holidays. Attending McIntosh High, Gretchen and Darcy's alma mater, insecure Megan learns that she has not been accepted into this year's version of the school's Herald Angels - founded by Darcy - who compete in the Montgomery County high school caroling competition. Darcy discovers that Megan's teacher who didn't even let her finish the audition is her high school adversary Adam, who nonetheless can point to results in the Angels having won the competition six years running under his leadership. Believing that all Megan needs is some confidence in understanding from Gretchen that she can sing when she thinks no one is listening, Darcy, both for Megan and herself, decides to form her own caroling group of Megan and some of the other students Adam didn't accept to compete against Adam's group to represent McIntosh at the competition. In the process of necessarily spending time with Adam, Darcy will learn where her priorities lie between that music career, family, romance and the Angels."

Exploring topics such as dreams versus reality, art as a means of survival, or the current immigration policies in Europe, the film invites us to become better acquainted with the people who will soon be our neighbors.		ar		https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/bluereddeport_2022/background.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/bluereddeport_2022/background.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/bluereddeport_2022/small-cover.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/bluereddeport_2022/medium-cover.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/bluereddeport_2022/large-cover.jpg	ok	[{'url': 'https://yts.mx/torrent/download/313D30E6B2652EB4707283761A4A41828334CB77', 'hash': '313D30E6B2652EB4707283761A4A41828334CB77', 'quality': '720p', 'type': 'web', 'seeds': 5, 'peers': 0, 'size': '750.22 MB', 'size_bytes': 786662687, 'date_uploaded': '2022-11-17 15:01:19', 'date_uploaded_unix': 1668693679}, {'url': 'https://yts.mx/torrent/download/9767C0215DF7021696AE780DE80B87EC20D2891F', 'hash': '9767C0215DF7021696AE780DE80B87EC20D2891F', 'quality': '1080p', 'type': 'web', 'seeds': 3, 'peers': 1, 'size': '1.36 GB', 'size_bytes': 1460288881, 'date_uploaded': '2022-11-17 15:56:10', 'date_uploaded_unix': 1668696970}]	2022-11-17 15:01:19	1668693679

No matter what befalls Aoyagi, his friends and parents believe in him because of his steadfast, almost irrational pleasantness.	gwNVJHETGvI	ja		https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/golden_slumber_2010/background.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/golden_slumber_2010/background.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/golden_slumber_2010/small-cover.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/golden_slumber_2010/medium-cover.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/golden_slumber_2010/large-cover.jpg	ok	[{'url': 'https://yts.mx/torrent/download/9FB8FC1EC0E55C30C62E5DBE9BD77017FB34CDB3', 'hash': '9FB8FC1EC0E55C30C62E5DBE9BD77017FB34CDB3', 'quality': '720p', 'type': 'bluray', 'seeds': 15, 'peers': 3, 'size': '1.26 GB', 'size_bytes': 1352914698, 'date_uploaded': '2022-11-18 14:18:08', 'date_uploaded_unix': 1668777488}, {'url': 'https://yts.mx/torrent/download/6DADC95AD35FBB4393808302D14B81B15C76502A', 'hash': '6DADC95AD35FBB4393808302D14B81B15C76502A', 'quality': '1080p', 'type': 'bluray', 'seeds': 8, 'peers': 8, 'size': '2.59 GB', 'size_bytes': 2780991324, 'date_uploaded': '2022-11-18 18:15:24', 'date_uploaded_unix': 1668791724}]	2022-11-18 14:18:08	1668777488

On their annual girls' weekend getaway to go antiquing, this time in San Francisco, they come across a late-nineteenth century Italian bridal veil. Enchanted not only by its beauty but the legend told to them that the owner will come into true love, they decide to purchase it as a group despite none of the three even close to getting married for one reason or another. Avery, the romantic and thus first of the three to have the veil in her possession, is in line for a promotion from associate to full curator at the museum. Avery not only is up against her cutthroat competitive colleague Jason for that promotion, but has to prove herself in her latest assignment to plan the museum's annual gala which she is to do with enthusiastic new Board member, Peter Hastings, the head of the Hastings Foundation founded by his late father, it which is branching out into artistic endeavors from its regular scientific focus. Avery is surprised to see that Peter is the handsome man she met in San Francisco, the two who she initially believed had a connection - the veil at work - he, however, suddenly turning cold toward her by the time they parted company in San Francisco, that about face change for a reason she does not know. As they work together, his emotions toward her at times cold and at times other times hot, they decide to center the gala on the unveiling of a long lost nineteenth century Italian painting Avery discovered in the museum's basement, its refurbishment which if not completed by gala time would negatively affect the reputation of the museum. Beyond discovering the reason for his changing emotions toward her, what happens between them is affected by the outcome of the gala and Avery's potential promotion by association, Peter's own search for his place in life outside of the legacy set by his father, and of course the power of the veil.

When a prince passes by, he notices what happened and uses his magical sword to free the children from the evil witches spell.	nxJ3QMi13OU	th		https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_upon_a_time_this_morning_1994/background.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_upon_a_time_this_morning_1994/background.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_upon_a_time_this_morning_1994/small-cover.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_upon_a_time_this_morning_1994/medium-cover.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_upon_a_time_this_morning_1994/large-cover.jpg	ok	[{'url': 'https://yts.mx/torrent/download/3A4B4D621F49C8D6AE11DC07D5DF27BC3AA333CD', 'hash': '3A4B4D621F49C8D6AE11DC07D5DF27BC3AA333CD', 'quality': '720p', 'type': 'web', 'seeds': 14, 'peers': 1, 'size': '1.17 GB', 'size_bytes': 1256277934, 'date_uploaded': '2022-11-17 13:02:28', 'date_uploaded_unix': 1668686548}, {'url': 'https://yts.mx/torrent/download/B5D72220FF11DE9FBC9BBB6598B0A28DB4FF9F9E', 'hash': 'B5D72220FF11DE9FBC9BBB6598B0A28DB4FF9F9E', 'quality': '1080p', 'type': 'web', 'seeds': 4, 'peers': 0, 'size': '2.17 GB', 'size_bytes': 2330019758, 'date_uploaded': '2022-11-17 16:43:29', 'date_uploaded_unix': 1668699809}]	2022-11-17 13:02:28	1668686548

The resulting turmoil, spent in a VA hospital, led to him suffering mentally, he now clinically deemed an idiot. The military having declared him legally dead in the ensuing time makes him open to abuse by anyone who wants to take advantage of him. While outwardly he seems an odd man to most, some can see below the surface to his wisdom and humanity. With nothing, he heads to Sapporo where his only contact to the outside world, Mr. Ono, will help him get back on his feet. En route, he befriends Denkichi Akama, a proverbial redneck who knows a certain darkness hangs over him. Akama went away to earn enough money to marry Taeko Nasu, a woman of ill-repute having lived her entire life the kept woman of older wealthy Mr. Tohata. Taeko is now an inconvenience in Tohata's life, and as such he has offered a substantial dowry to any man willing to take her off his hands. The man stepping forward is Mr. Ono's associate, Mutsuo Kayama, who truly loves Ono's daughter, Ayako, a straight-forward woman not one to suffer fools. Kayama vows that he will still marry Ayako if she makes the simple request to him not to marry Taeko. Upon his arrival in Sapporo, Kameda begins to fall in love with Ayako himself, while on their chance meeting, a deep emotional bond forms, which some construe as the truest of love, between Kameda and Taeko in each understanding the other's sadness. That bond does not sit well with Akama, who is more prone to violence than to peace and happiness. This situation becomes more complex as some try to do what is best for him/herself, while others want what is best for others, this potent mix which may lead to tragic consequences.

The brothers take her in, and the three live happy and celibate if not uneventful lives until the brothers are sent to jail for stealing."		it		https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ostia_1970/background.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ostia_1970/background.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ostia_1970/small-cover.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ostia_1970/medium-cover.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ostia_1970/large-cover.jpg	ok	[{'url': 'https://yts.mx/torrent/download/59016EBF268B59A71565BDBDCA88F4854E375A4C', 'hash': '59016EBF268B59A71565BDBDCA88F4854E375A4C', 'quality': '720p', 'type': 'bluray', 'seeds': 9, 'peers': 1, 'size': '919.12 MB', 'size_bytes': 963767173, 'date_uploaded': '2022-11-13 21:48:51', 'date_uploaded_unix': 1668372531}, {'url': 'https://yts.mx/torrent/download/F143A1A6F35DD5FCDE00ECFD602F7750D26594AC', 'hash': 'F143A1A6F35DD5FCDE00ECFD602F7750D26594AC', 'quality': '1080p', 'type': 'bluray', 'seeds': 6, 'peers': 3, 'size': '1.67 GB', 'size_bytes': 1793148846, 'date_uploaded': '2022-11-13 22:55:54', 'date_uploaded_unix': 1668376554}]	2022-11-13 21:48:51	1668372531

Part of that approval for Hillary is to marry the right man. That's why Hillary is so happy she is engaged to successful lawyer Jason King, whom she will bring home to meet the family for the first time at their Thanksgiving get-together weekend in a week's time; however, Hillary's life starts to fall apart when simultaneously she loses her part-time newspaper writing job (when the newspaper itself folds) and Jason dumps her to focus on his career (which is seemingly more important to him than Hillary). On the advice of her best friend Sophie, Hillary - who feels she can't go home without Jason (especially as her two sisters' lives seem to meet their mother's approval) - decides reluctantly to go to an online dating site to find someone to pose as Jason for the upcoming family weekend. She finds David, an actor who seems to be struggling with his own life; but, as an actor, she figures he can at least treat it like a real acting job (which he hasn't had in a while). It may be a struggle for David to pretend to be Jason for four days, especially as Hillary's politician father, Roy Burns, always seems to be seeking legal advice. Those problems may be compounded by Hillary herself, who treats David like the real Jason in the hopes that all the wedding planning she goes through with Meredith will end up not going to waste in the possibility that Jason may come back to her. By the end of the weekend, Hillary may finally come to some realizations about her mother and her sisters (the latter whose lives aren't as perfect as on first glance) and what - and perhaps who - she herself really wants in life, especially as an unexpected person also shows up for the weekend.

He is experimenting with smoking and openly preoccupied with the opposite sex, which makes him the brunt of jokes among his male classmates and constantly gets him into trouble with the school's strict headmaster, Father Fitzpatrick. As penance and to redirect his energies, Father Fitzpatrick orders Ralph to join the school's cross-country running team under the tutelage of the school's avant-garde-thinking teacher, Father Hibbert. Some of the more unusual circumstances of Ralph's life are that he lives by himself in the family home, telling the authorities that he is living with his paternal grandparents (who are in reality deceased), and telling his widowed, hospitalized mother (his father was killed in the war) that he is staying with a friend. Ralph's focus in life changes after his mother falls into a coma. It will take a miracle for her to come out of that coma. After two unrelated and somewhat innocent comments made to Ralph by Father Hibbert on prayer, purity, faith, and running the Boston Marathon, Ralph believes that that miracle will be him winning the 1954 Boston Marathon, for which he only has 180 days to train. To obtain the necessary physical and spiritual requirements to achieve this goal, Ralph receives some help from his friends Claire Collins and Chester Jones, and from Alice, one of the hospital's compassionate nurses. Although he believes Ralph's mission is misguided, Father Hibbert, who has his own secret past running history, becomes Ralph's personal trainer. These actions place Father Hibbert and Ralph at odds with Father Fitzpatrick, who sees his and other authority figures' roles as needing to show Ralph his place in life.

Carl and Robert, two slacker best friends who smoke hashish as a way of cheerful living - have been peddling hashish for a decade, hitting an all time high with this last batch: 45 Kilos of pure, high grade Nepalese Hashish destined for the draught-dry Oslo streets. In their own eyes they are not criminals they simply provide the life-essential drug to a suffering population. But then Glenn comes along, their friend and ambitious financial-backer-destined-to-be-a-yuppie. He has plans to make this deal even bigger than they have been led to believe.

Rebecca (actually just another alias) will stop at nothing to either find her perfect family or gruesomely punish everyone for their ""betrayal."""		en		https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_house_sitter_2015/background.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_house_sitter_2015/background.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_house_sitter_2015/small-cover.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_house_sitter_2015/medium-cover.jpg	https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_house_sitter_2015/large-cover.jpg	ok	[{'url': 'https://yts.mx/torrent/download/9EC514BF6FDE8C12B147A6500DE19A1D3472C281', 'hash': '9EC514BF6FDE8C12B147A6500DE19A1D3472C281', 'quality': '720p', 'type': 'web', 'seeds': 12, 'peers': 3, 'size': '766.44 MB', 'size_bytes': 803670589, 'date_uploaded': '2022-11-09 23:36:17', 'date_uploaded_unix': 1668033377}, {'url': 'https://yts.mx/torrent/download/152D24133AA970879E1FF4ABF76EE62B8DFCD3E2', 'hash': '152D24133AA970879E1FF4ABF76EE62B8DFCD3E2', 'quality': '1080p', 'type': 'web', 'seeds': 12, 'peers': 4, 'size': '1.54 GB', 'size_bytes': 1653562409, 'date_uploaded': '2022-11-10 00:40:19', 'date_uploaded_unix': 1668037219}]	2022-11-09 23:36:17	1668033377

Their father exploits their fear of a punishing creator, an existential threat living beyond the confines of the farm. Promising salvation, the father commands blind faith enforced by relentless discipline. One day in the field, Elijah, the youngest, collapses out of exhaustion. The father decides to make an example of him, punishing him for his petulance, banishing him to the outskirts to face certain death. Caleb, the eldest, tries to defend him but cannot bring himself to defy his father. When the father brings a new person into the family to replace Elijah, Caleb begins to question his upbringing, seeing through the cracks of his father's words. As he plots an uprising, pitting himself against his hell-bent father, he soon discovers that everything that has been told to him is a lie.
