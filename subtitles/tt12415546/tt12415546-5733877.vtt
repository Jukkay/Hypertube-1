00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.870
Over a century ago, beings that prey
on humans suddenly appeared.

2
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.926
Their absolutely overwhelming strength...

3
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.160
...quickly pushed humanity
to the brink of extinction.

4
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.766
The surviving humans constructed
three walls: Maria, Rose, and Sina,

5
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.346
which brought them a century of peace.

6
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.790
However...

7
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.660
{\an8}"Year 845 Shiganshina District"

8
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.500
Humanity was suddenly reminded...

9
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.910
...of the terror of being at their mercy...

10
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.080
Of the humiliation of being
trapped inside a cage...

11
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.750
They're inside!

12
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.540
Mom!

13
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.160
Mom!

14
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.346
...Eren!
...Mikasa! Grab that end!

15
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.250
We gotta move this pillar!

16
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.846
Eren! Take Mikasa and run away!

17
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.306
Hurry!

18
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.096
I want to!

19
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.726
So hurry and get out of there!

20
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.806
The debris has crushed my legs...

21
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.096
Even if I could get out,
I wouldn't be able to run.

22
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.136
Can't you see?

23
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.136
I'll carry you, then!

24
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.386
Why don't you ever listen to your mother?!

25
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.266
You can at least do this one last thing!

26
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.386
Mikasa!

27
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.056
No...

28
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.660
No...!

29
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.226
Hannes!

30
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.516
Take the children and get out of here!

31
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.386
Don't go underestimatin' me, Carla.

32
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.676
I'm gonna slaughter these Titans
and save all three of ya!

33
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.370
Wait! Don't fight them!

34
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.846
Hey! Mr. Hannes!

35
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.136
What are you doing?!

36
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.096
Mom's still...!

37
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.016
Eren! Mikasa!

38
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.580
You have to survive!

39
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.910
Stop!

40
00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.016
City districts like Shiganshina that
stick out in vital spots along the wall

41
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.306
serve to attract the Titans and streamline
security costs and troop numbers.

42
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.726
Performing true to its
role as a Titan target,

43
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.250
Shiganshina had but one inner gate
through which its citizens could flee.

44
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.346
What the...?

45
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.790
It's...!

46
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.330
Fire!

47
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.726
Several hours after the Colossal
Titan's appearance,

48
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.976
the Armored Titan bulldozed
through the wall's inner gate...

49
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.346
...shattering 100 years of peace.

50
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.386
Humanity abandoned one third of
their territory and fled Wall Maria.

51
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.726
You couldn't save your mother...

52
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.426
...because you lacked the strength.

53
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.790
I couldn't stand up to the Titan...

54
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.620
...because I lacked the courage!

55
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.596
I'm... going to...

56
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.636
Eren.

57
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.556
What's gotten into you, Eren?

58
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.120
Eren...

59
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.370
...drive them out!

60
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.516
I'm going to drive out...

61
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.910
...every last one from this world!

62
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:33.727
{\an8}"Year 850 Trost District"

63
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:35.559
- {\an8}"Year 850 Trost District"
- Give your hearts!

64
00:05:35.583 --> 00:05:37.177
- {\an8}"Year 850 Trost District"
- Yes, Sir!

65
00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:40.099
- {\an8}"Year 850 Trost District" - You have three
options after you graduate from the Cadets today!

66
00:05:40.123 --> 00:05:43.306
You have three options after you
graduate from the Cadets today!

67
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.426
The Garrison Regiment, which reinforces
the walls and protects each city!

68
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.016
The Scout Regiment, which risks life
and limb to venture outside the walls!

69
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.426
And the king's Military Police Regiment,
which polices the people and preserves order!

70
00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.806
Of course, the only ones allowed
to join the Military Police

71
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.330
are the top ten cadets
who were previously named!

72
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.766
Five years have passed since then...

73
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.266
We've lost a third of our land
and 20% of our people,

74
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.976
but humanity is finally
regaining its dignity!

75
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.750
We can win! Humanity's fight
back is just beginning!

76
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.516
Oww! Hot!

77
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.750
What the...?!

78
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.136
Year 850.

79
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.726
Once again, humanity was threatened
by the Colossal Titan.

80
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.676
You cadets have successfully graduated!
You are now proper soldiers!

81
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.096
I have high hopes for
you in this operation!

82
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.386
Are you okay, Armin?!

83
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.636
I'm fine!

84
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.386
I'll calm down soon enough!

85
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.056
Still, this is bad!

86
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.096
We don't have the technology to
quickly seal an eight-meter-high hole!

87
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.096
Unless we seal the hole,
this city's as good as lost!

88
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.676
Armin!

89
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.886
Calm down! This isn't like last time!

90
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.540
Humanity <i>won't</i> give in
to the Titans anymore!

91
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.056
I'm sorry...

92
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.580
I'm all right...

93
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.950
<i>That </i>many Titans?!

94
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.056
An Abnormal!

95
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.330
Stop!

96
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.290
Huh...?

97
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.556
What the hell are you doing?!

98
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.136
...Eren!
...Get back here, damn it!

99
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.476
You're gonna pay for killing Thomas!

100
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.080
I won't let you get away! I <i>won't</i>!

101
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.306
Stop! Please don't!

102
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.806
Why...?

103
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:46.750
Why am I watching as my friends get eaten?

104
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.910
Why... can't I move...?

105
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.790
A-Armin...

106
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.886
Eren! Eren!

107
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.806
Eren!

108
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:16.136
According to this book, most of the world
is covered in water called a "sea"!

109
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.926
And this "sea" is entirely saltwater!

110
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.516
Salt?!

111
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.096
There's a lot more than loads of salt, too!

112
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.596
Fiery water! Lands of
ice! Sandy snowfields!

113
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.226
The outside world must be <i>many </i>times larger
than the inside of these walls!

114
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.910
I hope we can explore the
outside world too someday!

115
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.580
Eren!

116
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:57.266
I <i>refuse </i>to die here...

117
00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:03.330
I have... to see it...
The outside world...!

118
00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.830
Eren! Hurry!

119
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.096
We live in a cruel world.

120
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.160
A cruel world in which
only the victors live.

121
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:40.556
In such a world, Eren gave me
a place to call home.

122
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.886
Warm, isn't it?

123
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:48.450
That was something I
couldn't bear losing again.

124
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.766
Where's Eren?

125
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.160
Armin?

126
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.306
I'm sorry, Mikasa...

127
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.950
It should've been me, not Eren...

128
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.000
Armin.

129
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.926
Calm down.

130
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.370
Now isn't the time to be emotional.

131
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.540
Now get up.

132
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.516
If we eliminate the Titans
swarming around HQ,

133
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.266
we can replenish our gas supplies
and get over the wall.

134
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.596
Correct?

135
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.636
But even with your help,
there's just too many...

136
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.726
I can handle them.

137
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.556
Huh?!

138
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.136
I'm strong.

139
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.886
Stronger than all of you.

140
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.846
I'm very strong.

141
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:50.306
As such, I <i>am </i>capable of
annihilating the Titans there!

142
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.556
Even if I have to go it alone.

143
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.516
You're seriously gonna take on
all those Titans by yourself?!

144
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.226
There's no way you can beat them!

145
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.056
If I can't,
then I'll die. It's that simple.

146
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.596
But... If I win, I'll live.

147
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.080
And the only way to win is to fight!

148
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.410
Hey!

149
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.136
She's not her usual, composed self at all!

150
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.000
She's trying to distract herself
from her anguish!

151
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.040
Mikasa!

152
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.976
It's this again...

153
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.580
I've lost my family again...

154
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:39.516
Do I have to revisit this pain...

155
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.750
...and start all over from here again?

156
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.556
Huh?

157
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.176
Why?

158
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.290
I was sure I'd given up...

159
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.160
Why... am I standing up?

160
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.500
Why... am I struggling?

161
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.660
After all...

162
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.450
There's no point in living anymore...

163
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.950
So what's driving me?

164
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.926
Fight!

165
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.636
Fight! Fight!

166
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.080
Eren...

167
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.136
I'm sorry, Eren...

168
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.540
I won't give up anymore...

169
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.096
If I die...

170
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.176
...I'll lose my memories of you, too,
on top of everything else.

171
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.676
So... I'll do whatever it takes to win!

172
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.910
Whatever it takes to live!

173
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.540
What just happened?!

174
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.160
A Titan...

175
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.700
...is killing...

176
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.370
...another Titan...

177
00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.476
I was completely confused.

178
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.926
But I also felt a faint glimmer of elation.

179
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.266
Because what I saw...

180
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:04.160
...looked like the manifestation
of humankind's anger.

181
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.000
Misaka!

182
00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:00.750
Damn it!

183
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.700
Damn it!

184
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.636
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

185
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.386
I refuse to give up!

186
00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.580
I'll drive them all out! Every last one!

187
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:26.290
By my own hand!

188
00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.750
I'll drive you out of this world...

189
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:39.346
More... I'm going to...

190
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.410
...kill more of you...

191
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.580
Eren?

192
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:59.016
Before I knew it, I was surrounded
by soldiers I thought were comrades.

193
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.806
It felt as if they were
looking at a monster...

194
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.226
...while brandishing weapons
made to kill Titans.

195
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.636
I can't remember how I got here,

196
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.870
but no matter what,
I refuse for this to be how I die!

197
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.266
Eren! Armin!

198
00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:17.580
Head up the wall!

199
00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:22.870
Eren.

200
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:29.636
When I get back, I'll show you the basement
that I've kept secret all this time.

201
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:34.136
Keep this key on you at all times.

202
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.176
And every time you see it, remember.

203
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.660
Remember that you <i>must </i>visit that basement!

204
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.886
You'll understand the truth someday
if you visit the basement!

205
00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.596
It will be a harsh, painful journey...

206
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.250
...but you <i>must </i>reach it!

207
00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.676
If you want to save Mikasa,
Armin, and everyone else...

208
00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:05.450
...you must learn to control this ability!

209
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:19.476
Using his Titan powers,
Eren protected Mikasa and me.

210
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.636
As the situation took a turn for the worse,

211
00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:27.476
he had faith in me and
entrusted everything to me.

212
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.306
"Eren isn't an enemy of humanity."

213
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:34.410
Using those words, I so proclaimed, but...

214
00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.290
That's enough.

215
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:43.290
I see you're still as delicate as
a young deer, despite your size.

216
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.516
But the one who saved us

217
00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:53.266
was the top officer in charge of the entire
southern territory, Commander Pyxis.

218
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:59.016
He listened to my idea and
immediately put a plan into motion.

219
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.636
Attention!

220
00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:07.926
I will now explain to you the details
of the Trost Recovery Operation!

221
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:14.306
He is the successful result of our
top-secret Titan transformation experiments!

222
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:19.226
In Titan form, he will lift that
giant rock near the front gate,

223
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:23.096
carry it to the wrecked gate,
and seal the hole!

224
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.846
As for <i>you</i>,

225
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:30.766
you're to defend him from the other
Titans while he carries the rock!

226
00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.386
Should this operation succeed,

227
00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:39.806
humanity will have taken back land
from the Titans for the very first time!

228
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:43.556
For humankind, that single, small step...

229
00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.080
...will be a great leap forward!

230
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.726
Eren! Don't you recognize me?!

231
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:11.056
I'm Mikasa! Part of your family!

232
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.950
Dodge, Ackermann!

233
00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:17.806
What the hell?!

234
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:20.766
He's just a regular, dumb Titan!

235
00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:22.266
Change of plans!

236
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:26.346
We're to defend Jaeger from the other
Titans until we can recover him!

237
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.410
He holds a precious chance for humanity.

238
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.540
Where am I?

239
00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.056
I'm home...

240
00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.596
Mikasa!

241
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.976
What happened to the plan?!

242
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.386
It's failed!

243
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.806
We're fighting because we
can't leave Eren behind!

244
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.136
But there are too many Titans...

245
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.910
At this rate, we'll be wiped out!

246
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.096
From the back of the head
to the nape of the neck...

247
00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.830
...one meter high and
ten centimeters across!

248
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.976
Eren... Answer me...

249
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.306
Even though just one step outside
the wall lies a hellish world...

250
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:15.250
Why did you want to venture
into the outside world?!

251
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.306
Why?

252
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:21.636
Because...

253
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.000
...I was born in this world!

254
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:34.330
Eren!

255
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.346
We can't go on, Captain!

256
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.120
It's just us now!

257
00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.250
We gotta give Eren
backup! Keep 'em off him!

258
00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:11.517
This way!

259
00:22:11.541 --> 00:22:13.160
Come get me!

260
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:24.290
Why did you want to venture
into the outside world?

261
00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:32.096
From the moment we're born, we're all...

262
00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.830
...free...

263
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:41.620
Some might try to deny that, but it
doesn't matter how strong they are!

264
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:48.556
Fiery waters... Lands of ice...
Or whatever else!

265
00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.016
Whoever gets to see those things...

266
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.290
...will have the greatest freedom
this world has to offer!

267
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:58.886
Fight!

268
00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:02.080
If anything is worth giving
your life, it's that!

269
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:08.250
It doesn't matter how terrifying
the world may be!

270
00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:14.790
It doesn't matter how
cruel the world may be!

271
00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.976
Fight! Fight!

272
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.700
Fight!

273
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.750
Go, Eren!

274
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.886
Everyone...

275
00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:00.700
Your deaths <i>weren't </i>in vain...

276
00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.846
Today, for the first time in history...

277
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:12.410
...humanity has beaten the Titans!

278
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:21.476
207 people were dead or missing,
and 897 were injured.

279
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.926
Although this was the first time humanity
had stopped a Titan invasion,

280
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:31.910
far too many people had been lost
to celebrate this historic achievement.

281
00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.096
Are you...

282
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.266
...Marco?

283
00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:42.290
I'm sorry...

284
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:46.476
I'm sorry...

285
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:51.040
It's no use apologizing.
We need to hurry and give them a funeral.

286
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:09.096
Commander Erwin, the head of
the Scouts Regiment's Task Force...

287
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.120
...and Captain Levi!

288
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:18.266
Dr. Jaeger's basement,
in your home in Shiganshina...

289
00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.926
A secret surrounding the
Titans is there, correct?

290
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:24.266
Yes. I think so.

291
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.516
That's what my father said.

292
00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.976
If we want to check out your home,

293
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.040
we'll need to take back Shiganshina
District along Wall Maria.

294
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.476
Sealing the damaged gate there
would be the best way to accomplish that.

295
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.660
Which means we'll need your Titan ability.

296
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.556
Your intentions are the key.

297
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.790
The key to saving
humankind from this despair.

298
00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.120
I'm...

299
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.476
I'm going to drive out...

300
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:07.096
...every last one from this world!

301
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.676
Hey. Answer the damn question, you twit.

302
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.290
What do you want to do?

303
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.476
I want to join the Scouts...

304
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.620
...and slaughter every Titan I can!

305
00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:29.306
Ah. Not bad.

306
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:33.516
Erwin. I'll take responsibility for him.

307
00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.016
Let the higher-ups know.

308
00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.136
I don't necessarily trust him, though.

309
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:44.176
If he betrays us or goes out of control,
I'll kill him on the spot.

310
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.056
You're in.

311
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.080
I'll make you a member of the Scouts.

312
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.516
The Scout Regiment's Special
Operations Squad... aka Levi Squad.

313
00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:01.016
They're the Scout's best of the best...
Elites chosen by Levi himself.

314
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:05.556
With them, I prepared for the
expedition outside the walls.

315
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.910
But around then, an incident occurred.

316
00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:15.306
Sawney! Beane!

317
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:19.830
No... Tell me this isn't happening!

318
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.556
They were such valuable test subjects...

319
00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.016
Did soldiers do this?

320
00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.556
Yeah. They haven't found who's responsible.

321
00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:33.886
The Titans that Section Commander Hange
captured alive for research

322
00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:37.176
had been killed by someone.

323
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.410
What do <i>you </i>see here?

324
00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.096
What do you think the enemy is?

325
00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.580
Huh?

326
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.370
Sorry. That was a strange thing to ask.

327
00:27:54.910 --> 00:28:00.226
The investigation that followed failed
to identify who killed the Titans.

328
00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:05.556
But after Mikasa, Armin, and our
classmates decided their regiments,

329
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.540
the day was upon us.

330
00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:13.636
Now commencing the 57th
Exterior Scouting Mission!

331
00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.000
Move out!

332
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.176
Mr. Oruo!

333
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.266
Do you think they... my classmates...
Can beat the Titans in a fight?

334
00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:28.726
Huh? What the hell did you just
spend this last month doing?!

335
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:30.726
Listen, kid!

336
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:35.950
Outside scouting missions are about
fighting Titans as little as possi...

337
00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.306
Assume long-range scouting formation!

338
00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:50.516
The expedition was meant to pave a route
to Shiganshina and Eren's house.

339
00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:57.846
However, it had a second objective,
which Erwin kept secret to all but a few.

340
00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:04.516
The arrival of a single Titan
caused a rapid turn of events.

341
00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:05.870
Armin!

342
00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:13.476
This one's <i>way </i>more athletic
than the other ones!

343
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.726
I'm dead!

344
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:18.870
Jean! Avenge that suicidal maniac!

345
00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.096
She stopped?

346
00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.926
It was her! She killed him!

347
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:28.726
He got himself killed in the right wing!

348
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.266
Avenge that suicidal maniac!

349
00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:32.540
Reiner...

350
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.500
Draw your swords.

351
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:12.700
If it shows itself,
we'll only have a moment.

352
00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:22.750
You're not going anywhere!

353
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:33.516
Eren! Focus ahead and keep moving!

354
00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.476
Are you saying to run
away and abandon them?!

355
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:37.886
Yes! I am!

356
00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:40.386
I don't understand why
we're letting them die!

357
00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.676
The captain decided you don't need to know!

358
00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:47.056
Why should I always have to rely on others?

359
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.886
I can just fight on my own!

360
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.596
What are you doing, Eren?!

361
00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:55.226
You're <i>only </i>permitted to do that
when your life is in danger!

362
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.790
That was our agreement, remember?!

363
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.516
Eren!

364
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.790
You're not in the wrong.

365
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.620
If you wanna do it, do it.

366
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.976
I can tell.

367
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.426
He's a real monster, and not
because of his Titan ability.

368
00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:20.176
Choose.

369
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:26.500
Will you trust yourself, or me, these guys,
and the entire Scout Regiment?

370
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.766
I don't know the right
choice. I never have.

371
00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:37.596
Whether I trusted myself or the choices
of my dependable comrades,

372
00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.596
there was no telling
how things would turn out.

373
00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:47.290
So, just do the best you can... and
choose whichever you'll regret the least.

374
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.290
I'll go with you!

375
00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.950
Let go!

376
00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.226
I'm sorry!

377
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.120
Keep moving! We need to outrun it!

378
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.580
Fire!

379
00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:33.136
The true goal of Erwin's plan was
to capture an Intelligent Titan...

380
00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.556
...using Eren to draw them out.

381
00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:43.056
With their capture, he hoped to
reveal the secrets of the Titans.

382
00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.700
However...

383
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:06.096
This goes to show... that the enemy
was prepared to throw away everything.

384
00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:09.516
I never imagined our target would
resort to Titan cannibalization

385
00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.910
to dispose of information...

386
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.346
Captain Levi?

387
00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:20.136
No... It's not!

388
00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.250
Who are you?!

389
00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.176
Mr. Gunther!

390
00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.266
Eren! Don't stop!

391
00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:35.426
Keep moving!

392
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:37.200
But Mr. Gunther is...!

393
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.017
Who's that?!

394
00:33:39.041 --> 00:33:41.056
Protect Eren!

395
00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.806
Is it the Female's operator?!

396
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:46.200
You're going down,
even if I have to die, too!

397
00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:53.976
If the enemy can remain able-bodied...

398
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.040
...it's possible it can make
the Titan reappear, too.

399
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.726
Damn... How could you?!

400
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.136
This time I <i>will </i>kill her myself!

401
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.136
No!

402
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.886
The three of us will take her down!

403
00:34:18.910 --> 00:34:22.250
You just keep heading
for HQ as fast as you can!

404
00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:36.636
We've blinded her!

405
00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:39.830
She should be in complete darkness
for at least a minute!

406
00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:46.056
We're going to carve you up...

407
00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.266
...and lop your arms...

408
00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:48.540
...off!

409
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.330
They're down!

410
00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.040
Next is the neck!

411
00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.620
Eld!

412
00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:09.636
Only one eye?!

413
00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.136
She healed just one eye quicker?!

414
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.870
Petra! Hurry!

415
00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:21.040
You're dead!

416
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:27.700
What? Why didn't my blades penetrate it?

417
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:34.500
I'm going to...

418
00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:37.450
I'm going to...

419
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:41.000
...kill her!

420
00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:55.500
That roar... Don't tell me it's...!

421
00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:59.636
I made the wrong choice...

422
00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:03.056
...because I wanted to trust my teammates!

423
00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.676
If only I believed in myself
and fought from the start...!

424
00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.016
If only I had killed her
from the very start...

425
00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.580
...then everyone might still be alive!

426
00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.976
With the failure of the 57th
Exterior Scouting Mission,

427
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.636
Erwin and the others in charge
were summoned to the capital...

428
00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:27.250
...and were ordered to hand over Eren.

429
00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:32.556
We believe we've found
who the Female Titan is.

430
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.886
We <i>will </i>capture her this time.

431
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:38.056
We do it the day after tomorrow,

432
00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:43.346
while passing through Stohess District
on our way to the capital.

433
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.596
The target is a member
of the Military Police.

434
00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.306
The Military Police?

435
00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:52.136
She might have trained with you
in the 104th Cadet Corps.

436
00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.476
The name of the girl we believe
to be the Female Titan...

437
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.870
Y-You can't be serious...

438
00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.830
...is Annie Leonhart.

439
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:18.620
Eren!

440
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:20.976
Eren!

441
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.226
It was Armin who identified her.

442
00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:28.346
The Female Titan knew what
you looked like from the start.

443
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:32.136
Plus, she reacted to your nickname
of "suicidal maniac,"

444
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:35.266
something only our classmates would know.

445
00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:36.726
The biggest reason, though,

446
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:41.700
is that I believe <i>she </i>killed the
test subjects Sawney and Beane.

447
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.096
Killing them would've required real skill,

448
00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.846
so she would've used the ODM gear
she'd become accustomed to.

449
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:54.386
Yeah,
but they held that equipment inspection.

450
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:56.266
Annie's was fine.

451
00:37:56.290 --> 00:38:00.926
Because she presented Marco's gear.

452
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:01.887
Eren.

453
00:38:01.911 --> 00:38:05.700
Does this talk about Annie ring any bells?

454
00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:14.080
You know, don't you?

455
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:19.766
You know the Female Titan is Annie.

456
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:21.266
I know.

457
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:23.056
I failed before...

458
00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:27.790
...when I clung to my friends
and the bond we shared...

459
00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.120
Think back...

460
00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:44.726
I'm going... to wipe them out...!

461
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:46.346
No...

462
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:48.160
Slaughter them!

463
00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:56.096
There's no time to think
whether it's right or wrong!

464
00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.056
Just act!

465
00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.266
Don't try to end things all nice and neat!

466
00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:02.926
Yes...

467
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:04.676
Mikasa!

468
00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.540
We live in a cruel world!

469
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:30.950
Eren!

470
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.766
Eren...

471
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:35.226
Annie...

472
00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:41.290
You always acted like everything bored you.

473
00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:46.306
The only time you
ever seemed full of life...

474
00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:49.870
...was when you showed
off your fighting moves!

475
00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.330
Whoa...

476
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.080
Annie...

477
00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:24.450
All I ask of you... is one thing...

478
00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:31.000
Even if you turn the whole world
against you, it's okay.

479
00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:39.250
So promise me...

480
00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:42.790
...that you'll come back...

481
00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.200
Huh? What's he doing?

482
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:06.080
They're merging?!

483
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:15.290
Don't go eatin' our key evidence,
you idiot...

484
00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.306
Annie was crying.

485
00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:24.410
After seeing her like that,
I completely froze up.

486
00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:29.846
Seems the plan wasn't much of a success.

487
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:37.620
No, I'd say the Scout Regiment's
in the clear now. Just barely.

488
00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.620
Let's hope so...

489
00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.426
H-Hey, is that...

490
00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:53.766
...a Titan?!

491
00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:56.056
What's that in the wall?

492
00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.450
It can't be!

493
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:03.056
Was that there just by coincidence?

494
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:07.000
Or does this mean...?!

495
00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.346
Pastor Nick?

496
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:16.346
Whatever you do...

497
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:20.700
Do <i>not </i>let the sunlight touch that Titan!

498
00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:29.386
From then on, things unheard of
began to happen, one after another.

499
00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:33.080
Tell me, what is that weapon called?

500
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:38.846
That thing on your waist that flies around.

501
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:41.620
Wel... come... home...

502
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:48.476
Did you follow the wall here, too?

503
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:49.556
Yeah.

504
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.426
Where did you find the hole?

505
00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:52.870
Huh?

506
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:56.886
Despite no reports of holes in the wall,

507
00:42:56.910 --> 00:43:01.660
Titans appeared out of nowhere
in increasing numbers.

508
00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:08.306
Meanwhile, Pastor Nick of the Order
of the Walls broke his silence

509
00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:12.846
about the walls' secrets
he swore to take to the grave.

510
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:20.266
I can tell you the name of one whom
the sacred will instructed us to monitor.

511
00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:21.790
Monitor?

512
00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:28.200
That person has joined the Scout
Regiment as of this year.

513
00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:33.056
Their name is...

514
00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.426
Quit it, Christa!

515
00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:36.266
The tower's about to crumble!

516
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:37.386
You'll fall!

517
00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:40.426
But they're dying in our place!

518
00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:41.096
...Nanaba...

519
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:41.886
...No! No! ...Nanaba...

520
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:42.847
...No! No! ...And Gelgar...

521
00:43:42.871 --> 00:43:44.596
Father, stop!

522
00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:45.726
Father!

523
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:48.426
I'm sorry! No, don't!

524
00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:51.386
Father! No!

525
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:53.976
She's the smallest one of us.

526
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.226
She's got long golden hair.

527
00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:59.386
Um, and...

528
00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:00.307
She's cute.

529
00:44:00.331 --> 00:44:02.726
She's always hanging around Ymir.

530
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.266
Huh? Ymir?

531
00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:06.580
Here.

532
00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.386
Thanks.

533
00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:12.676
What do you want it for?

534
00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.000
Hmm?

535
00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:17.846
I'm going to fight with this.

536
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:19.410
Ymir...

537
00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:22.266
Christa.

538
00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:27.346
I have no right to tell you
how to live your life.

539
00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:32.120
So actually, this is nothing more
than a hope of mine...

540
00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:37.330
I want you... to live
a life you're proud of.

541
00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:43.370
Ymir! Wait!

542
00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.830
Ymir!

543
00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:13.516
Attacked by Titans at Utgard Castle,
Christa and the others were saved...

544
00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:19.750
...by someone who could turn into a Titan
like Eren... a comrade from the 104th.

545
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:23.976
It can't be...

546
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.386
Ymir is...

547
00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:28.080
Ymir...

548
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.580
My real name...

549
00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:43.200
...is Historia.

550
00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:51.580
And once again, there was
a drastic turn of events.

551
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.226
Annie's?

552
00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:55.227
Yeah.

553
00:45:55.251 --> 00:46:01.580
There were two others belonging to the 104th
Cadet Corps who came from the same area as her.

554
00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:06.660
Reiner Braun... and Bertholdt Hoover.

555
00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:15.346
As their comrade,
I'd find it hard to believe.

556
00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:17.636
Set aside Bertholdt, who doesn't say much.

557
00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:23.160
Reiner is like everyone's big brother, and
he's not devious enough to deceive all of us.

558
00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.266
I agree.

559
00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:30.136
Reiner gave everything he had
fighting the Female Titan with me.

560
00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:34.040
He would have gotten crushed
in her hand if he hadn't...

561
00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.346
What's wrong?

562
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:40.516
Reiner managed to escape, but...

563
00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:43.266
...Annie suddenly changed her course...

564
00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:47.016
...and ran in the direction of Eren.

565
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:51.096
When that happened, the Female Titan
was staring into her palm.

566
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:55.080
He might have written a message
with his blades in her hand.

567
00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:57.950
Reiner could've...

568
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:03.806
Eren.

569
00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:05.176
Have a minute?

570
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.846
We need to talk.

571
00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:09.330
What about?

572
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:15.676
Five years ago, we demolished the wall
and began our attack on humanity.

573
00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:20.176
Oh, no... What if there's a Titan
that dug a hole underneath the wall?

574
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.056
The hole will be hard to find in that case.

575
00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:26.516
I'm the Armored Titan
and he's the Colossal Titan.

576
00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:30.556
Right now, we need to focus
on getting Ymir back safely.

577
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:34.476
Even with horses, we still have
to worry about Titans.

578
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.016
Huh?

579
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.476
What are you talking about?

580
00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.726
Why are you telling him, Reiner?

581
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:45.056
Our primary goal was to ensure
all of humanity was wiped out,

582
00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:49.016
but now there's no need for that.

583
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.176
Eren.

584
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:56.120
If you agree to come with us, we won't
have to destroy any more of the walls.

585
00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.346
You understand, right?

586
00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:59.806
Huh?

587
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.660
Hey! We're leaving!

588
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:07.636
You're just tired, aren't you?

589
00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:12.516
Besides, if you were really the Armored
Titan that wants to destroy humanity...

590
00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:16.596
...why would you be asking me
this in the first place?

591
00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:22.000
What did you think would happen?
That I'd nod and say "Sure, let's go"?

592
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:30.976
Oh, right.

593
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.556
That's right.

594
00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.040
What the hell was I thinking?

595
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:52.676
It's too late now... I don't know
what's right anymore.

596
00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:55.886
But the only choice for me now...

597
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:59.080
...is to face the
consequences of my actions...

598
00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.846
...and as a warrior...

599
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:06.120
...fulfill my duty to the bitter end!

600
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:12.540
We settle this! Right here, right now!

601
00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:24.540
Eren! Run!

602
00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:32.830
Eren! Get out of there!

603
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:57.870
Ymir!

604
00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:01.766
I'm going to return to
the hometown we lost.

605
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:05.290
That's all I care about now.

606
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:08.476
Bertholdt...

607
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:10.330
Reiner...

608
00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:20.000
You damn traitors!

609
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:44.636
Mikasa?

610
00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.476
Armin! Where's Eren?!

611
00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.806
Mikasa, calm down!

612
00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:52.580
You shouldn't be moving!
We don't know how badly you're injured!

613
00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:00.136
Where is he?!

614
00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.660
Eren was taken away.

615
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:07.370
Ymir, too, by Bertholdt and Reiner.

616
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:14.306
Eren... He lost to the Armored Titan.

617
00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:17.200
It's been five hours since then.

618
00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:21.226
Is anyone...?

619
00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:23.700
Is anyone chasing them?

620
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.500
No...

621
00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:33.176
Hey, Armin.

622
00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.016
Why?

623
00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:40.306
Why does Eren always go
somewhere far away from us?

624
00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:43.676
Yeah, now that you mention it...

625
00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:50.806
Eren has always run off on his own,
leaving us behind...

626
00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:57.160
I guess that's just the way things are
meant to happen... for Eren at least.

627
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:08.410
But all I want... is to be at his side.

628
00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:14.636
Mikasa? So you're up, huh?

629
00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:16.176
I bet you're hungry.

630
00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.660
Here, eat this.

631
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.700
Armin, catch.

632
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:26.700
As usual, field rations are all there is.

633
00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:31.886
Hmm...

634
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:36.250
Tastes neither good
nor bad. Same as always.

635
00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:44.346
Speaking of which,
this is the same as always, too.

636
00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:50.636
Ever since the good old days, you two have
been there to clean up the mess of that brat.

637
00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:54.410
That's what I call a lousy
relationship. Sheesh.

638
00:52:56.580 --> 00:53:00.476
I loved those good old days.

639
00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:07.136
If you asked Eren, he'd say those days
were nothing more than a false peace.

640
00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:12.700
But for me, I'm more than happy
to be a drunk, useless soldier.

641
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:20.676
If it means getting back those plain,
ordinary days, I'll do whatever I have to.

642
00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:23.580
No matter how long it takes to get there.

643
00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:26.726
I'm coming, too.

644
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:32.500
Without you three together again,
I can't bring back the good old days.

645
00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:45.346
For now,
let's get to a place without Titans!

646
00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:48.266
We need to get as far away as possible!

647
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:50.766
My Titan form isn't very fast.

648
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:54.266
If I get surrounded, I won't
be able to protect you guys!

649
00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:58.176
Then why didn't we
just wait until nightfall?!

650
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.476
Smoke signals? Did the
Scouts come to rescue us?

651
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.426
It must be Commander Erwin.

652
00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:05.370
A tough opponent!

653
00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:10.040
Shit... They're already that close?

654
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.726
A light?

655
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:17.806
Soldiers, disperse!

656
00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:20.540
Locate Eren and recover him!

657
00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.250
Advance!

658
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:50.226
Commander Erwin!

659
00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:54.306
Advance!

660
00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:56.476
Eren is just ahead!

661
00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.830
Advance!

662
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:30.660
All soldiers, retreat!

663
00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.790
Eren! Mikasa!

664
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:09.410
Eren!

665
00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:15.790
Hannes!

666
00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.476
You just watch.

667
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:24.750
I'm about to avenge your mother
and butcher the shit out of this!

668
00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:27.830
Hannes!

669
00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:33.226
Christa!

670
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:35.516
Conny, that's wrong.

671
00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:38.306
My name is Historia.

672
00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:39.516
Ymir...

673
00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:43.500
You're the one who said it,
so listen to yourself!

674
00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:47.266
Stop living for other people!

675
00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:51.500
From now on, let's live for
nobody but ourselves!

676
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.540
What's wrong?!

677
00:57:05.290 --> 00:57:06.750
Eren!

678
00:57:26.370 --> 00:57:27.886
Right now...

679
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:30.250
...I've gotta become a Titan...

680
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:35.080
...or it's all for nothing!

681
00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.636
Eren...

682
00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:17.476
Nothing changed!

683
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:21.226
You haven't changed one bit, dammit!

684
00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:24.750
You're still as useless as you ever were!

685
00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:29.056
Nothing changed!

686
00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.976
Mom...

687
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:36.636
I still... can't do anything at all.

688
00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:38.120
Eren...

689
00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.370
That's not true.

690
00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:49.910
Eren...

691
00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.410
I need to tell you something.

692
00:58:57.950 --> 00:59:01.846
You've always... been at my side.

693
00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:03.540
Thank you.

694
00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:12.040
You showed me... how to live with purpose.

695
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.790
Thank you.

696
00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:22.000
And you...

697
00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:27.306
You wrapped this scarf around me.

698
00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:29.120
Thank you.

699
00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:44.330
I'll wrap that around you...
as many times as you want.

700
00:59:46.330 --> 00:59:50.660
Now and forever... as much as you want!

701
01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:35.056
Dunno what's going on,
but now's our chance!

702
01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.516
Let's hurry and run!

703
01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:37.766
Right!

704
01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:39.766
So that's how it is...

705
01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:43.476
That's why Reiner was
so desperate for Eren.

706
01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.846
Which means, even inside the walls...

707
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:48.790
...there's a future.

708
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:53.056
This is the worst...

709
01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:58.306
Why did the Coordinate have to fall into
the hands of the worst person imaginable?

710
01:00:58.330 --> 01:01:00.766
We've gotta get it back...

711
01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:04.306
I can say... without a doubt...

712
01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:07.726
...the one person in the world
I wouldn't want to have it...

713
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:11.346
...is you, Eren!

714
01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:13.886
Get away from me!

715
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:17.330
You bastards! I'll kill you all!

716
01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:23.950
Not good! Bertholdt!

717
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:26.080
Eren!

718
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:28.177
Get on!

719
01:01:28.201 --> 01:01:30.226
Armin!

720
01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:31.976
Hurry!

721
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.176
Don't let this chance escape!

722
01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.250
Full retreat!

723
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.596
Ymir!

724
01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:44.410
Hey, ugly! What are you doing?!
We're heading back!

725
01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.620
I sorry...

726
01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:55.120
Huh?

727
01:01:59.830 --> 01:02:02.096
Ymir! Where are you going?!

728
01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.500
...Leave her! ...But Ymir is...

729
01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:18.476
In that moment, I couldn't understand
the motivation behind Ymir's actions...

730
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:22.660
...but the Armored Titan
didn't pursue us any further.

731
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.886
{\an8}"Trost District"

732
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:43.150
- {\an8}"Trost District" - Say again?

733
01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:49.660
The Titans responsible for this incident...
were the citizens of Ragako?

734
01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:55.596
In other words,
the true identity of Titans...

735
01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:58.000
...is humans?

736
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:03.910
We don't... have proof yet.

737
01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:13.620
Erwin.

738
01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:20.016
Hey. Tell me.

739
01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.386
The hell you smiling for?

740
01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:28.016
Soon after, Pastor Nick, who revealed
Historia's identity, was murdered.

741
01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:32.136
The government put a freeze
on all Scout activity as well.

742
01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.516
And after apprehending Erwin,

743
01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:38.726
they ordered the Scouts to
hand over Eren and Historia.

744
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:45.136
The plan to plug the wall with his Titan
powers was regrettably put on hold.

745
01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.097
Watch out!

746
01:03:46.121 --> 01:03:47.410
Behind us!

747
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:53.636
A-Armi...

748
01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.056
I mean, Christa and Eren!

749
01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.910
They got snatched away again!

750
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:03.556
Will it really work?

751
01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:07.346
He looks absolutely nothing like me...

752
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:10.450
That horse face? Yeah right...

753
01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:19.056
Yeah? You like that? Let me hear you moan.

754
01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:23.346
Well? How's that? Doesn't it feel good?

755
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:27.040
I'm just dying to hear
your cute little voice.

756
01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:36.636
This is why I didn't wanna go
through this shit a second time!

757
01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:39.556
Screw being his body double!

758
01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:42.250
Hey! Get outta the way!

759
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:45.346
Something is wrong...

760
01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:48.096
The Military Police can't be behind this.

761
01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:53.096
They're far too arrogant.
They wouldn't use amateurs.

762
01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:56.386
Nifa,
have you heard about Kenny the Ripper?

763
01:04:56.410 --> 01:04:59.136
The mass-murderer in the capital?

764
01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.136
The one that slit the throats
of over 100 Military Police?

765
01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:06.096
That's just an urban legend
from years ago, right?

766
01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.926
He is real, and the stories are true.

767
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:10.016
Huh?

768
01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:13.056
I lived with him for a
while when I was a kid.

769
01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.766
What? Why would you even say that?

770
01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:18.120
This isn't the time to be making jokes.

771
01:05:19.830 --> 01:05:21.000
Nifa!

772
01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.660
Yo, Levi.

773
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:37.080
You grown any yet?

774
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.450
Kenny!

775
01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:51.040
Kaboom!

776
01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:08.450
Historia!

777
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:13.000
Eren!

778
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:26.790
Shit! They predicted every
last one of our movements!

779
01:06:49.790 --> 01:06:51.516
Oof!

780
01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:56.426
Shit... If this keeps up, I'll lose
my team, Eren, and Historia, too.

781
01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:57.267
Tsk!

782
01:06:57.291 --> 01:07:02.516
Ain't that the damnedest thing! I
smell a filthy rat coming from this bar...

783
01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:05.226
Come out, you little rodent...

784
01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:07.226
Found ya!

785
01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:10.016
The law has come to exterminate the vermin!

786
01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.886
Bang! Bang!

787
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:14.250
Eek!

788
01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:18.676
The hell?! Ain't you here?!

789
01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.676
Right here, Kenny. It's been a while.

790
01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:24.846
Never thought you'd still be alive.

791
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:27.976
I been looking forward
to seeing you in action.

792
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.330
Never thought all those tricks I taught you
would be helping you out like this.

793
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:39.266
We had no choice but to survive
in that garbage dump.

794
01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:42.636
It took all we had each day to keep livin'.

795
01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:49.346
And when we found out how big the world
really was, you can bet it hurt like hell.

796
01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:52.306
But something saved us...

797
01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:56.726
We'd found something we
wanted to do. It's that simple.

798
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:58.386
It's simple, but the truth is...

799
01:07:58.410 --> 01:08:02.476
The only thing that made our lives
fulfilling was finding hobbies.

800
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:07.806
Hobbies? So is blowing the heads
off my team another hobby of yours?

801
01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:12.976
Yup... To achieve my grand goals,
I'll kill as much as I have to.

802
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.476
You're no different.
You kill when it benefits you, too.

803
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.750
Yeah...

804
01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:23.016
Wait!

805
01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.976
Captain...

806
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.096
Gunshots!

807
01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.080
...Huh? ...From there!

808
01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.200
I heard a bunch of shots!

809
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:34.886
You think something happened?

810
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:37.306
Most likely.

811
01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:39.556
The Captain had this message for us...

812
01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:44.540
From now on, we'll be fighting
humans, too, and not just Titans.

813
01:08:47.830 --> 01:08:50.476
Please forgive me for everything.

814
01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:54.676
In order to protect you,
I had no other choice.

815
01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:57.346
F-Father...

816
01:08:57.370 --> 01:09:01.660
You're special... Royal
blood runs through you.

817
01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:06.346
It... does?

818
01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:10.266
Our Reiss family is the true royal line.

819
01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:15.766
And because you're special, you're the one
and only person who can save all of humanity.

820
01:09:15.790 --> 01:09:18.266
Now, let us go, Historia.

821
01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:21.886
To the place it all began...

822
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:27.926
Having learned Reiss was the true
royal family, Erwin led a coup d'état.

823
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:31.766
Together with Zachary,
the head of all regiments,

824
01:09:31.790 --> 01:09:35.290
he dismantled the government in power.

825
01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:42.176
As far as humanity's concerned, we should
have let the government do as they please.

826
01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.226
Like Commander Pyxis was saying,

827
01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:48.806
they've somehow devised a means
of keeping humanity alive until now.

828
01:09:48.830 --> 01:09:52.306
Should I have let Eren go,
risked my comrade's lives,

829
01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:58.226
given up both my life and my duty,
and entrusted it all to the government?

830
01:09:58.250 --> 01:10:02.330
If humanity is more precious
than one single life...

831
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:09.176
Your duty is as painful as ever.

832
01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.450
Dying seems a far easier option.

833
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:17.790
In that case, why didn't you do as you say?

834
01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:21.386
I...

835
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:24.056
...have a dream.

836
01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.540
One I've had since I was a child...

837
01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:37.096
Before the night is over,
we'll have soldiers all over Reiss' land.

838
01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:41.426
Unfortunately, I doubt
he'll be waiting that long.

839
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:46.976
If we don't hurry and get there,
Eren may end up being eaten.

840
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.096
Eren overheard Ymir
and Bertholdt talking...

841
01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:57.346
If a Titan eats a person who can change into
a Titan and thus inherits their powers...

842
01:10:57.370 --> 01:11:00.346
If that's actually true...

843
01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:07.556
When and how did Eren become a Titan,
and who did he eat to gain his powers?

844
01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:10.500
At one time, I had five children.

845
01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.636
But my wife, all of my children,
Frieda included,

846
01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:22.580
were killed five years ago
by his father, Grisha Jaeger.

847
01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:36.226
Five years ago, my dad was
superior to all other Titans.

848
01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:40.096
He ate Historia's sister
and stole her power...

849
01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:44.080
...and then I... ate my dad.

850
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:49.870
Dad?

851
01:11:58.870 --> 01:12:03.056
Now, that power resides within Eren.

852
01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.886
However, that power...

853
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:10.726
It can't truly manifest unless the blood
of the Reiss family runs through them.

854
01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:15.096
As long as he remains
a vessel for that power...

855
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.176
...this hell will forever continue.

856
01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.976
Eh?

857
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.806
Then...

858
01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:25.226
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

859
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:27.056
Kenny.

860
01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:32.676
So unless it's a Reiss who eats Eren,
they can't become a true King?

861
01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.266
That is correct.

862
01:12:34.290 --> 01:12:40.726
Th-Then... Even if I turn into a Titan
and eat Eren, it'll mean nothin'?

863
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:42.516
I see now...

864
01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:47.516
My Titan powers... It was pointless
for me to ever have them.

865
01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:53.136
It was my dad who started this hell
that's stolen so many lives.

866
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.306
I can never atone for it all.

867
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:58.176
It shouldn't have happened...

868
01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.426
Those days of training...

869
01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:03.226
That dream beyond the walls...

870
01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:07.000
I... shouldn't have happened.

871
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.176
You both become Titans and have at it.

872
01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:14.846
If Historia wins, you'll have your peace.

873
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:19.540
But if you lose to Eren,
the situation stays the same.

874
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:26.426
Keep drawing breath till I run out and die?

875
01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:29.830
Can you even call that livin'?!

876
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:32.540
Father...

877
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:38.346
Why didn't the Reiss family...
in that whole 100 years...

878
01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:43.136
...eliminate the Titans
and liberate humanity?

879
01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.596
All while possessing the power
to control all the Titans...

880
01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:53.176
Because, the first Reiss King who
built this world within the walls...

881
01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.636
...wished for us to be
controlled by the Titans.

882
01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:03.000
The First King believed that was
the only path to true peace.

883
01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:09.290
Christa.

884
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.580
I want you... to live
a life you're proud of.

885
01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:27.580
Historia!

886
01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:37.556
God, my ass! You're just giving yourself
an out and manipulating other people!

887
01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:41.620
I've had it! I won't let you kill me!

888
01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:46.870
Father...

889
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:49.476
Uri...

890
01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.306
Frieda...

891
01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:53.226
Wait for me...

892
01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:56.870
I'll... now...

893
01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:08.330
Historia!

894
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:10.976
You okay?

895
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.056
Mikasa!

896
01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.370
Captain? You guys...

897
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.726
Conny, hurry!

898
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:21.016
Forget about me!

899
01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.620
Captain! Hurry and escape!

900
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:26.727
He's loose!

901
01:15:26.751 --> 01:15:27.950
Get back!

902
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:40.750
I'm sorry, everyone...

903
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:48.136
I've been nothing but useless...

904
01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:54.290
Ever since the very beginning,
I was never the hope of humanity...

905
01:15:58.290 --> 01:16:00.426
Armor?

906
01:16:00.450 --> 01:16:03.976
What's this? Think you're some tragic hero?

907
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.226
When have you ever accomplished
anything by your strength alone?

908
01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:09.846
What a weakling.

909
01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:12.266
We've been through much worse than this.

910
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:14.346
Not that I wanna get used to it!

911
01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:15.976
I'll take Eren.

912
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.386
It's useless.

913
01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:19.056
We can't escape.

914
01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:20.556
So do nothing?

915
01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:24.136
You wanna sit here and hold hands
till we're crushed or burn to death?

916
01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.226
You know, I hate doing this
to you every time, but...

917
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:30.426
Eren.

918
01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:32.910
You've gotta make the choice.

919
01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.910
I'll go with you!

920
01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:48.016
Eren!

921
01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:50.016
I'm sorry...

922
01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.596
Since it's the end, just this once...

923
01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:55.516
...I want you to let me...

924
01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:58.040
Let me believe in myself!

925
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:12.660
Everyone! Get underneath Eren!

926
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:26.676
Rod Reiss became a Titan,

927
01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:31.636
demolishing the chapel before
crawling towards Orvud District.

928
01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:38.580
Within the blast, Eren had succeeded
in hardening for the first time.

929
01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:42.676
Historia.

930
01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.766
Forgot to tell you...

931
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:46.976
We need you to do something.

932
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.330
Yes?

933
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:52.976
Erwin's orders.

934
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.596
When this battle is over, since you're
the true successor to the throne...

935
01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:59.266
...become the Queen.

936
01:17:59.290 --> 01:18:00.346
Eh?

937
01:18:00.370 --> 01:18:01.177
Huh?

938
01:18:01.201 --> 01:18:03.136
Q-Queen?!

939
01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:09.016
The coup d'état was successful, but the people
won't follow a regiment sitting at the top.

940
01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.386
What we need is a story to spread.

941
01:18:11.410 --> 01:18:16.476
That a true heir retook
the crown from the fake.

942
01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.120
I...

943
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:23.886
My next duty is to be Queen, right?

944
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:26.176
Understood.

945
01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.266
Historia...

946
01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:31.886
Captain, I do have one condition.

947
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:33.176
Hmm?

948
01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.886
Since my fate is my own,
I want to lay it all on the line.

949
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:40.346
What the hell are you thinking, Erwin?!

950
01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:44.096
Keep the citizens in the city
without evacuating?!

951
01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:48.636
By the time it's dawn,
that Titan will be all over us!

952
01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:54.096
The target Titan is strangely attracted
to high concentrations of people.

953
01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.726
Hence, Abnormal.

954
01:18:55.750 --> 01:19:00.767
- {\an8}"Capital Mitras" "Orvud District" - If right now,
you were to evacuate the citizens within Wall Sina,

955
01:19:00.793 --> 01:19:06.017
- {\an8}"Capital Mitras" "Orvud District" - it would be drawn
towards them, destroying the wall and all in its path.

956
01:19:06.043 --> 01:19:11.306
If we are to stop that Titan, we must do so
outside the walls of Orvud District.

957
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:14.806
Wall-mounted cannons should
prove highly effective, but...

958
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:18.056
If that's not enough to bring it down...

959
01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:21.870
The Scout Regiment will throw
everything we have at it.

960
01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:28.080
Hey.

961
01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:32.476
The kids in this city remind me...

962
01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.870
...of us on that day.

963
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:37.926
Yeah...

964
01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:43.500
Nobody thinks today is the day
a Titan bigger than the wall attacks.

965
01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:48.476
They might end up seeing
the same sight as we did that day.

966
01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.926
But there's one big difference.

967
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:54.226
Atop the walls,
soldiers stand to face the Titan.

968
01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:56.926
And that would be us.

969
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:59.750
Yeah, stack it up on the edge.

970
01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.426
Eren.

971
01:20:06.450 --> 01:20:09.950
There's no time to stop.
Keep your hands busy.

972
01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:14.830
Eren!

973
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:17.386
Wh-Whoa!

974
01:20:17.410 --> 01:20:19.556
What are you doing?!

975
01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.016
Making a wound?

976
01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.886
It's too early for that!

977
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:24.096
No...

978
01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:27.386
Just beating the shit
out of a useless brat.

979
01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:31.476
I hope he's dead and gone for good.

980
01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:32.950
Fire!

981
01:20:36.370 --> 01:20:40.016
Historia's become incredibly strong.

982
01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:43.636
I thought she was the weak one,
but I was wrong.

983
01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:47.226
The weak one was me.

984
01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:48.790
Let the attack...

985
01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:51.660
...commence!

986
01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:09.750
Eren!

987
01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:34.386
All troops! Finish it off with ODM gear!

988
01:21:34.410 --> 01:21:36.016
It may be gigantic,

989
01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:40.056
but its vitals are still one meter high
and ten centimeters across.

990
01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.846
Unless we destroy the main body,

991
01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:45.766
it will regenerate and form
another shield of heat.

992
01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:47.346
We've only got one shot.

993
01:21:47.370 --> 01:21:48.476
Hot!

994
01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:51.596
Shit! Which is it?!

995
01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:53.556
Historia?!

996
01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:58.136
I understand your reasons, but...
I can't approve you entering combat.

997
01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:00.346
Commander, please!

998
01:22:00.370 --> 01:22:03.886
I've finally grasped the duty
I was meant to fulfill!

999
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:06.926
That's why I'm here right now!

1000
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:11.056
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

1001
01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:15.726
But this is the first time
I've gone against my parents...

1002
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:19.540
This is my first fight... with my father.

1003
01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:26.346
Father!

1004
01:22:26.370 --> 01:22:27.886
Listen to me, Father!

1005
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:29.676
...We can kill the Titans,
once and for all!

1006
01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:31.266
...You know I'll be fine, Brother...We
can kill the Titans, once and for all!

1007
01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:34.596
Alma,
you're the only one who understands me...

1008
01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:36.250
Oh, God...

1009
01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:56.950
Were you the one who
dealt the finishing blow?

1010
01:22:58.410 --> 01:23:01.926
Was that all... my imagination?

1011
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:04.556
Am I... really...

1012
01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:08.056
...acting on my own accord?

1013
01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.096
But...

1014
01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:12.790
The one always going with the flow is...

1015
01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:15.950
...without a doubt, me.

1016
01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:19.290
I am...

1017
01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:23.476
I am Historia Reiss.

1018
01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:26.040
The true ruler of the walls.

1019
01:23:31.450 --> 01:23:32.750
Kenny.

1020
01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:42.096
With those burns and that blood loss...

1021
01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:45.040
...there's no helping you now.

1022
01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:49.330
Yeah?

1023
01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:52.450
I wonder...

1024
01:23:55.620 --> 01:24:01.096
I swiped this little one
right out of Rod's bag.

1025
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:07.136
Seems if I inject this...
I'll turn into a Titan.

1026
01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:12.306
You've had the time and
strength to inject yourself.

1027
01:24:12.330 --> 01:24:14.886
Why haven't you?

1028
01:24:14.910 --> 01:24:19.266
Yeah... I... don't wanna die...

1029
01:24:19.290 --> 01:24:21.750
...and wanted power.

1030
01:24:23.290 --> 01:24:26.556
But... I see...

1031
01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:27.950
Huh?

1032
01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:43.500
Everybody I've met... was all the same.

1033
01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:46.886
Drinking...

1034
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:49.016
Women...

1035
01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.136
Worshiping God, even...

1036
01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:59.306
Everyone had to be drunk on
somethin' to keep pushing on...

1037
01:24:59.330 --> 01:25:03.846
Everyone... was a slave to somethin'.

1038
01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:06.370
Even him...

1039
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:16.886
A-And what are you?

1040
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:18.830
A hero?!

1041
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:22.136
Kenny.

1042
01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:24.676
Tell me everything you know!

1043
01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:28.806
Why doesn't the First King
want humanity to survive?!

1044
01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:31.136
Beats me...

1045
01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:34.556
But... we Ackermann's...

1046
01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:38.500
...opposed him... for that reason.

1047
01:25:40.830 --> 01:25:44.426
My last name seems to be Ackermann, too.

1048
01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:45.886
You...

1049
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:49.136
What were you to my mother?

1050
01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.450
Heh, you idiot...

1051
01:25:52.410 --> 01:25:55.160
Just her brother.

1052
01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:05.726
That day... why?

1053
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:08.080
Why did you leave me?

1054
01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.976
Because...

1055
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.306
...I'm not meant to be...

1056
01:26:18.330 --> 01:26:21.040
...someone's father...

1057
01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:31.750
{\an8}"2 Months Later"

1058
01:26:33.250 --> 01:26:35.886
The final operation to retake Wall Maria...

1059
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:37.750
...will now commence!

1060
01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:45.346
Now possessing the invaluable
weapon of Titan hardening,

1061
01:26:45.370 --> 01:26:50.386
the Scouts returned to Shiganshina,
the place it all began.

1062
01:26:50.410 --> 01:26:51.870
However...

1063
01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:07.636
Keep on the lookout!

1064
01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:09.700
Locate his allies!

1065
01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:23.226
We're both hoping for the same thing...
To settle it here once and for all.

1066
01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:25.476
Humanity or Titans?!

1067
01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:29.426
Which side will live?!
Which side will perish?!

1068
01:27:29.450 --> 01:27:30.926
This is...

1069
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:32.226
...where I...

1070
01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:35.426
...where we once called home!

1071
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:37.266
I'm taking it back!

1072
01:27:37.290 --> 01:27:42.120
I'll slaughter you all...
and take back what you stole!

1073
01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:56.886
Using the new Thunder Spears,

1074
01:27:56.910 --> 01:28:00.726
the Scouts had driven the
Armored Titan into a corner,

1075
01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:06.516
but the enemy's counterattack
was way beyond their expectations.

1076
01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:07.910
The signal!

1077
01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:12.500
Tsk!

1078
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:18.910
Reiner!

1079
01:28:20.370 --> 01:28:21.750
Hange!

1080
01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:34.950
Shit...

1081
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.290
Eren! Go stop his lanky legs!

1082
01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:02.886
Armin,
we need you to observe him from afar.

1083
01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:05.846
We gotta believe there's a way to beat him!

1084
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:07.700
Now! Scatter!

1085
01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.410
What?

1086
01:29:24.910 --> 01:29:26.500
Eren!

1087
01:29:28.410 --> 01:29:30.886
Hey! The horse got away!

1088
01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:32.516
That was your job!

1089
01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:34.806
Shut up! Like it matters?!

1090
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:36.596
Excuse me?!

1091
01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:40.886
Those Scouts were insanely strong
and they died in an instant!

1092
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:43.386
You know as well as I do!

1093
01:29:43.410 --> 01:29:46.176
What good is protecting horses...

1094
01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:49.450
...when there's nobody
left to ride them home?!

1095
01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:56.596
If the plan goes well, you may be able
to take down the Beast Titan.

1096
01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:58.596
But it will take the recruits...

1097
01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:00.950
...and myself to give our lives.

1098
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:07.556
For this to work...

1099
01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:10.136
To ask these young ones to die,

1100
01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:14.976
it would take an expert con man
and a whole slew of lies.

1101
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.596
If I do not lead the vanguard,
none of them will follow.

1102
01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:22.516
And I will die before anyone else.

1103
01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:28.136
Without ever learning
what's in the basement...

1104
01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:29.500
Huh?

1105
01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:38.346
I...

1106
01:30:38.370 --> 01:30:40.790
I want to go to the basement.

1107
01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:44.176
Everything I've done till now...

1108
01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:47.200
...was because I thought
this day would come.

1109
01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:50.040
But, Levi...

1110
01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:55.080
Can you see them? Our comrades?

1111
01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:01.596
Our comrades are looking at us.

1112
01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:05.200
They want to know what became
of the hearts they gave.

1113
01:31:09.450 --> 01:31:12.306
You've fought well.

1114
01:31:12.330 --> 01:31:15.950
It's all thanks to you
that we've come this far.

1115
01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:19.830
I'm making the choice.

1116
01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:24.176
Give up on your dream and die.

1117
01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:27.516
Lead the recruits straight into hell.

1118
01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:30.910
I will take down the Beast Titan.

1119
01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:37.790
Charge!

1120
01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:42.726
A suicide charge?

1121
01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:46.976
Here I was thinking they could
do better than that...

1122
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.450
Now! Fire!

1123
01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:56.136
I'm announcing our final operation!

1124
01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:01.016
We'll wait until he's ready to throw
and fire our smoke signals together.

1125
01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:04.346
That should reduce his accuracy somewhat.

1126
01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:09.806
While we're acting as a decoy,
Captain Levi will kill the Beast Titan.

1127
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:12.306
That is our plan.

1128
01:32:12.330 --> 01:32:13.636
What?

1129
01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:17.136
You want me to go after
him with just ODM gear?

1130
01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.346
He's standing in an empty area.

1131
01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:22.386
There's not even a house or tree in sight.

1132
01:32:22.410 --> 01:32:23.790
Wrong...

1133
01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:28.950
There happens to be a line of objects
at just the right height.

1134
01:32:30.370 --> 01:32:33.136
Sneak close using the Titans...

1135
01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:35.660
...and assassinate the Beast Titan.

1136
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:45.266
I'm sorry...

1137
01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:50.556
We die trusting the living who follow
to find meaning in our lives!

1138
01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:56.636
That is the sole method in which
we can rebel against this cruel world!

1139
01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:58.846
My soldiers, rage!

1140
01:32:58.870 --> 01:33:01.096
My soldiers, scream!

1141
01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:04.200
My soldiers, fight!

1142
01:33:13.410 --> 01:33:15.136
I have a plan.

1143
01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:17.596
You all need to draw Reiner away.

1144
01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:20.830
Eren and I will defeat Bertholdt ourselves.

1145
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:25.160
The two of us can win
and I'm going to prove it.

1146
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:28.136
All right.

1147
01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:29.410
Hmm?

1148
01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:32.386
What's that?

1149
01:33:32.410 --> 01:33:34.950
My Titans have fallen...

1150
01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:50.096
Huh?

1151
01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:52.766
I need to watch out for a single soldier?

1152
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:56.556
Yes. Captain Levi is dangerous.

1153
01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:58.750
Is this Levi?

1154
01:33:59.950 --> 01:34:01.160
My nape!

1155
01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:04.926
What the...?

1156
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:06.750
I can't see a thing!

1157
01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:09.540
Did he take out my eyes?

1158
01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:12.500
My legs!

1159
01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:17.016
What happened to all
that fun you were having?!

1160
01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:18.976
Tsk! I'll harden!

1161
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.386
Shoot, I won't make it!

1162
01:34:20.410 --> 01:34:23.160
Come on, let's try to enjoy this!

1163
01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:43.806
Isn't anyone out there still alive?

1164
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:50.450
If they are, even on the brink of death,
this injection will make them a Titan.

1165
01:35:01.330 --> 01:35:05.176
For some reason,
when I think of the outside world...

1166
01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:07.620
...courage flows through me.

1167
01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:15.750
Eren, wake up!

1168
01:35:18.330 --> 01:35:20.500
Let's go look at the sea!

1169
01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:32.476
Wait...

1170
01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:35.926
I made a promise to him...

1171
01:35:35.950 --> 01:35:38.910
...that I'd kill you no matter what.

1172
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:41.830
I promised!

1173
01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:56.370
Shit...

1174
01:36:02.830 --> 01:36:04.250
Eren!

1175
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:16.806
Armin...

1176
01:36:16.830 --> 01:36:19.726
All the way to the very end...

1177
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:21.750
...you fought well.

1178
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:31.426
Why?

1179
01:36:31.450 --> 01:36:33.660
I can't blow Armin away...

1180
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:36.596
I knew it...

1181
01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:38.976
His bones aren't being consumed!

1182
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.766
The anchors stay put
if they're not in muscle!

1183
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:47.636
But most importantly, he can't move
his body while he's emitting steam!

1184
01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:51.846
But, Armin... is this how you go out?

1185
01:36:51.870 --> 01:36:55.726
In all your wisdom, the best plan
you could come up with...

1186
01:36:55.750 --> 01:37:00.306
...was to get scorched to death like this?

1187
01:37:00.330 --> 01:37:04.426
I can't breathe! I have to let go...

1188
01:37:04.450 --> 01:37:06.636
No! Not yet!

1189
01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:08.976
It's not enough!

1190
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.346
I've gotta buy more time!

1191
01:37:12.370 --> 01:37:15.676
What's he trying to
accomplish? A diversion?

1192
01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:19.040
But Eren's still beat to a pulp over there.

1193
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.290
I'll make it quick for you.

1194
01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:27.426
Hold on!

1195
01:37:27.450 --> 01:37:29.926
Don't let go!

1196
01:37:29.950 --> 01:37:32.306
I entrust it to Eren!

1197
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:36.766
My dreams... My life... Everything!

1198
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:42.226
This is the one and
only thing I have to give!

1199
01:37:42.250 --> 01:37:44.386
I'm sure...

1200
01:37:44.410 --> 01:37:46.556
...Eren will...

1201
01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:49.750
...reach... the sea...!

1202
01:37:51.370 --> 01:37:52.910
He'll look at...

1203
01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:56.660
...the sea for me!

1204
01:37:59.870 --> 01:38:01.500
It's over...

1205
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:07.410
Hardening...?

1206
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:15.290
Gotcha!

1207
01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:50.886
Eren... You should know.

1208
01:38:50.910 --> 01:38:54.176
We promised to go to the sea together,
right?

1209
01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:57.160
Have I ever lied to you in my life?

1210
01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:05.410
Armin...

1211
01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:10.160
Why... don't you run away?

1212
01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:17.500
A Titan?

1213
01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:23.476
You just try coming closer!

1214
01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:26.660
Make one move to take him and he's dead!

1215
01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:33.056
Are you...

1216
01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:35.596
...Eren Jaeger?

1217
01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:38.386
If nothing else, I'm taking him with me!

1218
01:39:38.410 --> 01:39:41.500
You look nothing like your father.

1219
01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.120
My... dad?

1220
01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:50.596
Argh... You're kidding me!

1221
01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:53.000
He chased me all the way here?

1222
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:58.000
Eren! Someday,
I'm coming back to rescue you!

1223
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:04.500
He ran?

1224
01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:09.346
Captain!

1225
01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:11.226
That was the last of my gas.

1226
01:40:11.250 --> 01:40:13.976
I'll chase him! Hand
over your gas and blades!

1227
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:14.927
Right!

1228
01:40:14.951 --> 01:40:16.200
Hurry!

1229
01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:26.096
Today, I would like to explain...

1230
01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:30.290
...how we're going to get maximum
value from this injection.

1231
01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:34.056
The one injected with
this will become a Titan,

1232
01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:38.016
and eat someone who can change
into a Titan like Eren can.

1233
01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:42.676
By doing so, although they would initially
be a Titan lacking intelligence,

1234
01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:47.556
they would revert into a human
able to wield that Titan's powers.

1235
01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:54.000
Furthermore, we'll be able to revive
a person on the brink of death.

1236
01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:58.016
We have only this one injection.

1237
01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:01.870
I'm entrusting the call to
use it with Captain Levi.

1238
01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:05.830
Yeah! Keep it up!

1239
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:10.370
Armin's breathing again!

1240
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:15.250
Come on! Just keep on breathing!

1241
01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:18.136
Armin?

1242
01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:20.950
Captain! Get the syringe!

1243
01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:27.556
Make Armin into a Titan
and we'll have him eat Bertholdt!

1244
01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:29.830
Hurry up and inject him!

1245
01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:33.620
Yeah...

1246
01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:39.516
Captain... Levi...

1247
01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:42.136
I finally found you.

1248
01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:44.806
Commander Erwin is badly wounded!

1249
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:48.596
His stomach is gouged...
and his organs are demolished!

1250
01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:51.386
The blood just won't stop!

1251
01:41:51.410 --> 01:41:54.846
I thought that injection might
be able to help, but...

1252
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:56.410
What do you think?

1253
01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:03.500
Huh?

1254
01:42:14.410 --> 01:42:17.620
I'm using the injection... on Erwin.

1255
01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:44.016
You should know as well as I do!

1256
01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:48.556
Without Erwin's talent,
humanity can't beat the Titans!

1257
01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:53.926
It's... no different if we lose... Armin.

1258
01:42:53.950 --> 01:42:55.386
Eren!

1259
01:42:55.410 --> 01:42:59.306
Hasn't it... always been like that?

1260
01:42:59.330 --> 01:43:03.516
He's the reason why we saved Trost
by plugging it with a rock.

1261
01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:06.226
He revealed Annie's identity.

1262
01:43:06.250 --> 01:43:08.886
The only reason we defeated Bertholdt...

1263
01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:12.346
...was all because of Armin!

1264
01:43:12.370 --> 01:43:16.476
The one who's gonna save humanity
isn't me or the commander!

1265
01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:18.200
It's Armin!

1266
01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:23.806
The one who will save humanity...
is Commander Erwin.

1267
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:29.120
When I found the commander alive,
I was about to finish him off.

1268
01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:35.976
But... that's going too easy on him.

1269
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.450
I thought to myself that he ought
to taste more of this hell.

1270
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:46.330
Hange...

1271
01:43:50.370 --> 01:43:55.056
Hey... You've got to be... kidding me...

1272
01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:56.790
No way...

1273
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:02.660
Captain...

1274
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:08.766
Do you... know about... the sea?

1275
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:13.806
No matter how far you look,
it stretches past the horizon.

1276
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:16.660
It's a gigantic lake.

1277
01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:18.597
Armin said...

1278
01:44:18.621 --> 01:44:21.476
Hey! Cut it out!

1279
01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:24.726
There's a sea beyond the walls...

1280
01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:28.386
...and he said we'd go there together!

1281
01:44:28.410 --> 01:44:31.306
Armin cares about more than just fighting!

1282
01:44:31.330 --> 01:44:33.660
He has dreams!

1283
01:44:37.330 --> 01:44:39.636
Everyone get out of here!

1284
01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:43.620
I'm going to have Erwin eat Bertholdt!

1285
01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:47.790
Come on. Let's go, Mikasa.

1286
01:44:56.410 --> 01:44:59.806
Let's start by seeing the sea!

1287
01:44:59.830 --> 01:45:02.950
You'll see! It does exist!

1288
01:45:09.330 --> 01:45:11.476
I...

1289
01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:14.080
I want to go to the basement.

1290
01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.976
Good grief.

1291
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.136
They're all the same...

1292
01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:23.176
Whining like brats one after another...

1293
01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:30.016
Everyone had to be drunk on
somethin' to keep pushing on...

1294
01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:34.976
Everyone... was a slave to somethin'.

1295
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.386
But there's more than that.

1296
01:45:37.410 --> 01:45:39.160
The sea...

1297
01:45:46.410 --> 01:45:48.846
Erwin!

1298
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:51.096
Teacher...

1299
01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:55.516
How do we know there're not more humans...

1300
01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:59.040
...outside the walls?

1301
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:09.676
Levi...

1302
01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:11.450
Thank you.

1303
01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:27.846
Captain...

1304
01:46:27.870 --> 01:46:31.306
Why... did you...?

1305
01:46:31.330 --> 01:46:36.096
Do you think... you can forgive him?

1306
01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:39.250
He had no choice but to become a devil.

1307
01:46:40.370 --> 01:46:43.120
It was us who wished for that.

1308
01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:49.136
And in the end, when he had
finally been set free from hell,

1309
01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:52.976
we wanted to bring him back once more.

1310
01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.450
But I think... it's time to let him rest.

1311
01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:03.660
Why... did you pick me?

1312
01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:06.806
No matter how you look at it,

1313
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:10.926
wasn't Commander Erwin
the right one to bring back?

1314
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:14.346
The final decision to choose you was mine.

1315
01:47:14.370 --> 01:47:15.766
No...

1316
01:47:15.790 --> 01:47:19.830
I chose this to be the
place where Erwin dies.

1317
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:23.056
I...

1318
01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:25.636
...have a dream.

1319
01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:28.806
One I've had since I was a child...

1320
01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:32.556
There will come a moment when
we learn the truth of our world...

1321
01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:34.926
...and I must be there for it.

1322
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:38.386
Is it that important to you?

1323
01:47:38.410 --> 01:47:40.306
More than your legs?

1324
01:47:40.330 --> 01:47:41.926
Yes.

1325
01:47:41.950 --> 01:47:44.926
More than humanity's victory?

1326
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:46.500
Yes.

1327
01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:54.096
Right here.

1328
01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:56.806
Under this are the stairs to the basement.

1329
01:47:56.830 --> 01:47:58.250
Good.

1330
01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:06.040
It opened.

1331
01:48:07.330 --> 01:48:10.926
This is... a portrait?

1332
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:12.580
Let me see that.

1333
01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.540
That's Dr. Jaeger's writing.

1334
01:48:18.410 --> 01:48:20.516
"This is no illustration.

1335
01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:24.346
Instead, this uses light
reflected off a subject

1336
01:48:24.370 --> 01:48:27.476
and burns the image on special paper.

1337
01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:30.136
It's called a photograph.

1338
01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:31.596
I come from a place"...

1339
01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:35.620
...outside the walls where
humanity lives in elegance.

1340
01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:39.700
Humanity has not perished.

1341
01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:44.976
I was born into a race known as "Eldian."

1342
01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.886
Our ancestor Ymir Fritz obtained
the Power of the Titans

1343
01:48:48.910 --> 01:48:51.636
and tyrannized other peoples.

1344
01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:57.176
But 80 years ago, the once-great nation
of Marley won the Great Titan War...

1345
01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:00.596
...and the Empire of Eldia collapsed.

1346
01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:06.886
The empire's King Fritz built three huge
walls on their territory of Paradis

1347
01:49:06.910 --> 01:49:10.176
and took refuge there with his people.

1348
01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:12.886
However, not all of them came.

1349
01:49:12.910 --> 01:49:17.226
The remaining Eldians
abandoned on the mainland

1350
01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:21.476
were put in internment zones
and discriminated against.

1351
01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:24.476
In time, I became a member

1352
01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:29.176
of a revolutionary group called
the "Eldian Restorationists."

1353
01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:34.516
That is where I met Dina Fritz,
a woman of royal blood,

1354
01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:37.976
who blessed me with a son, Zeke.

1355
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:44.676
And so, in order to restore the empire,
I raised Zeke to be a Marleyan warrior

1356
01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:49.426
in a plot for him to
inherit the Seven Titans.

1357
01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:54.476
However, Zeke betrayed us.

1358
01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:56.080
We're here.

1359
01:49:57.910 --> 01:50:00.926
This is... paradise.

1360
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:02.346
That's right.

1361
01:50:02.370 --> 01:50:06.636
The penal colony of Eldian
traitors: Paradis Island.

1362
01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:09.516
This is where you'll
serve your life sentence.

1363
01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:12.000
As a Pure Titan, that is.

1364
01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:28.926
My comrades were turned into Titans.

1365
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:31.870
And then, Dina, too.

1366
01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:37.846
Grisha, I...

1367
01:50:37.870 --> 01:50:42.926
No matter what form I take,
I promise I'll come and find you.

1368
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:46.450
Dina!

1369
01:50:57.700 --> 01:51:00.056
Eren, calm down.

1370
01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:01.926
You're in the stockades.

1371
01:51:01.950 --> 01:51:05.226
You and Mikasa are serving time
for insubordination.

1372
01:51:05.250 --> 01:51:08.516
Were you having a nightmare, Eren?

1373
01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:11.846
Yeah... I was...

1374
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:17.120
I feel like... I just woke up
from the longest dream ever.

1375
01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:22.596
No, not a dream...

1376
01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:24.200
Memories...

1377
01:51:25.330 --> 01:51:27.306
That Titan...

1378
01:51:27.330 --> 01:51:29.410
It was you...

1379
01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:32.790
Dina...

1380
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:44.266
That day, I met the informant
who posed as a Marleyan officer...

1381
01:51:44.290 --> 01:51:47.386
...and leaked information
to the Restorationists.

1382
01:51:47.410 --> 01:51:52.700
From this man named the "Owl,"
I inherited Titan powers.

1383
01:51:55.200 --> 01:52:00.450
If the Founding Titan falls into
Marleyan hands, Eldia is done for.

1384
01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:04.926
The King in the walls wouldn't
allow that to happen.

1385
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:06.976
The King in the walls won't fight.

1386
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.160
Huh?

1387
01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:11.846
The King of the walls stole
his people's memories

1388
01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:16.516
and made them believe humanity
perished beyond the walls.

1389
01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:21.636
You must find that cowardly King
and strip him of the Founding Titan.

1390
01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:24.330
That is our mission.

1391
01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:28.386
Mr. Jaeger later achieved his mission

1392
01:52:28.410 --> 01:52:32.386
and entrusted the Founding
Titan to his son Eren.

1393
01:52:32.410 --> 01:52:38.176
Eren was able to control Pure Titans
in the past to escape a dire situation.

1394
01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:45.266
So it may be possible, even without royal
blood, for Eren to wield that power as well.

1395
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:47.636
That's right...

1396
01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:52.040
Just for that split second,
it felt like everything connected.

1397
01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:57.226
My name is Dina Fritz.

1398
01:52:57.250 --> 01:53:00.306
I'm a descendant of the royal family.

1399
01:53:00.330 --> 01:53:04.016
If someone with royal blood
is made into a Titan that I touch,

1400
01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:08.596
it might be possible for me to use
the Founding Titan's powers.

1401
01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:12.016
That's right... It's just a possibility...

1402
01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:17.700
But if they knew of that possibility,
what would the military do to Historia?

1403
01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:24.830
Six years after the Colossal
Titan's first attack...

1404
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:29.726
Refugees were permitted
to return to their hometowns

1405
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:35.290
and the Scouts once again resumed
expeditions past Wall Maria.

1406
01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:41.976
Have a family.

1407
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.016
Huh?

1408
01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:46.476
Your wife, your child,
your neighbors if need be...

1409
01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:49.040
Love someone inside the walls.

1410
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:53.926
If you can't do that, it'll only repeat.

1411
01:53:53.950 --> 01:53:58.846
The same history... The same
mistakes... Over and over...

1412
01:53:58.870 --> 01:54:04.476
To save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone
else, you must see it through.

1413
01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:09.136
Mikasa? Armin? Who is that?

1414
01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:12.556
Who knows? I'm not sure...

1415
01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:14.660
Whose memories are those?

1416
01:54:23.370 --> 01:54:28.096
This is the place where Eldians
were made into Titans.

1417
01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:31.080
And... beyond that...

1418
01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:49.096
Look!

1419
01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:51.846
I told you, Eren!

1420
01:54:51.870 --> 01:54:55.266
A salt lake so big that merchants
could spend their whole lives

1421
01:54:55.290 --> 01:54:58.556
and still not get all the salt.

1422
01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:02.750
The stuff I talked about
wasn't wrong after all!

1423
01:55:04.910 --> 01:55:06.726
Yeah...

1424
01:55:06.750 --> 01:55:10.000
It's so damn big...

1425
01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:16.636
Look,
Eren! On the other side of the wall...

1426
01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:18.580
There's a sea.

1427
01:55:21.370 --> 01:55:25.700
On the other side of the sea... is freedom.

1428
01:55:27.790 --> 01:55:30.700
That's what I always believed.

1429
01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:37.410
But I was wrong.

1430
01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:43.926
On the other side of
the sea... are enemies.

1431
01:55:43.950 --> 01:55:49.540
Every part of this is exactly how
I saw it in my dad's memories.

1432
01:55:57.580 --> 01:55:59.040
Hey...

1433
01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:06.226
If we kill all our enemies... over there...

1434
01:56:06.250 --> 01:56:10.540
...will we finally... be free?
